Decision 
MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 13, 2020. 
On April 7, 2021 , the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated 
Adjudication Services (CAS) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging 
security concerns under Guideline F. The CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
On October 31, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR ( Answer; Ans ) and 
requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On January 14, 
2022, she responded to the Government’s written case, a file of relevant material (FORM 
Response). On May 23, 2022, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative

judge. The Government was ready to proceed on June 15, 2022. The hearing case was 
assigned to me on May 4, 2023. On May 12, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for July 12, 202 3, after 
Applicant’s request for delay was granted for good cause . On July 11, 2023, the parties 
agreed to the new hearing date of August 11, 2023 , after Applicant’s request to 
reschedule was granted for good cause . Due to an inadvertent administrative error, 
DOHA did not issue the second hearing notice until August 8, 2023. Given the date of the 
parties’ actual notice and Applicant’s affirmative waiver of the 15-day notice requirement, 
I convened the hearing as rescheduled via video conference. 
Applicant testified and I admitted Applicant Exhibit s (AE) A through C, and 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 into evidence, without objection. I appended to the 
record two Government administrative documents as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II. With 
notice to the parties, I, sua sponte, took administrative notice of facts, as discussed further 
below, from U.S. government sources, which I appended to the record as Administrative 
Exhibits (AX) 1 and 2. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open until October 31, 2023, 
to allow h er the opportunity to submit additional information . She did not provide any 
additional documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 21, 2023. 
SOR Amendment  
At the  hearing, I granted  the  Government’s motion, without objection, to  amend  the  
SOR by withdrawing  SOR ¶ 1.h  to conform to the record. (GE 7;  Tr. at 8-9, 68)  
Findings of Fact  
Applicant, age 44, is unmarried with three adult children, ages 23, 22, and 19, and 
three minor children, ages 16, 14, and 5. All three adult children are active duty military 
service members. She honorably served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 
1998 through 2003. In 2003, she earned an associate degree from University A. On and 
off between 2009 and 2019, and consistently since 2023, she has taken classes at 
University B toward earning a bachelor’s degree , expected in 2025. She has been 
employed by a defense contractor (Sponsor) as a systems support engineer since 
January 2020. This is her first application for a security clearance . (GE 1; Tr. at 10 -11, 
20, 29, 42-43, 47-50, 86-88, 158, 159-160, 172) 
Applicant has been married and divorced five times. She had no children with 
Husband #1 (1998 to 1999) or Husband #3 (2008 to 2009). Husband #2 (2001 to 2007) 
fathered her three oldest children; Husband #4 (2012 to 2016) her 14-year old child; and 
Husband #5 (2018 to 2022) her five -year old child. She never married her 16 -year old 
child’s father. She neither paid, nor was awarded, spousal support. She stated she was 
allocated “a large portion” of marital debt in her 2007 divorce decree. The record does not 
indicate any SOR allegations involve the marital debts allocated in her 2007 divorce 
decree beyond the student loans discussed further below. She incurred no joint debt 
during her other marriages. (Ans; GE 1; Tr. at 19-20, 42-46, 86-89)

Applicant was ordered to pay child support for her three oldest children, as 
discussed further below. She neither received nor paid child support for her three 
youngest children. She and Husbands #4 and #5 share equally all expenses associated 
with her two youngest children. She filed a child-support petition for her 16-year-old child 
in about 2010, but she was not awarded child support until about 2012, due to a service 
of process delay. There remain two active arrest warrants against her 16-year-old child’s 
father for his failure to pay any amount of child support. He has yet to be located. (GE 1; 
Tr. at 43-46, 86-89,157-158) 
Applicant worked for a law firm from 2003 until 2005, when her third child (Child 
#3) was born with special needs, as discussed further below. She remained unemployed 
as a “stay at home mom” (SAHM) until December 2010, when she began working full time 
for another defense contractor (Employer A) as a material handler . Throughout most of 
the security clearance process, she reported being laid off in October 2012 due to a 
government shutdown; however, in her Answer, she recounted the year as 2013. She 
remained unemployed as a SAHM until October 2014, when she be gan working for a 
grocery store (Employer B), initially as part-time manager trainee, and then as full -time 
manager. In June 2018, she resigned due to a flare-up of a chronic medical condition, 
which rendered her unable to perform the physical duties of her job. She worked on and 
off in various part -time positions at a retailer, a farmer’s market, and “some[place] else” 
until January 2019, when she became employed full time by another defense contractor 
(Employer C) as a material planner. In January 2020, she resigned to pursue her current 
position. (Ans; GE 1; Tr. at 20, 29-33, 49, 95-107, 123) 
Applicant was “pigeonholed” into being a SAHM between October 2012 and 
October 2014 due to the lack of available contracts in her field ; her inability to find any 
other jobs that paid enough to offset the cost of childcare required by her three children 
and Husband #4’s children; and her “very volatile” marriage to Husband #4, who was 
“financially and emotionally abusive.” Between June 2018 and January 2019, she 
similarly struggled to secure a full-time position with a schedule and salary that met her 
childcare needs. (Ans; GE1; Tr. at 19-20, 29-30, 100) 
SOR Allegations  
Applicant disclosed financial problems on her January 2020 SCA . She provided 
additional details during her March 16, 2020 security clearance interview (SI1) and March 
24, 2020 follow up to SI1 (SI2), in her October 2021 Answer (Ans) and January 2022 
FORM response, and during her testimony in August 2023. (AE A; GE 2, 3, 4, 6; Tr. at 
99, 100) 
Tax Issues. Applicant failed to timely file and pay, as required, her tax year (TY) 
2018 federal income tax return (SOR ¶ 1.a ) and her TY 2018 federal income taxes of 
$400 (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Ans; GE 1, 5, 7; Tr. at 51-60, 116-117) 
On her 2020 SCA, Applicant proffered a plan to hire a tax professional to address 
both self-reported TY 2018 tax issues. During her 2020 SI1, she asserted she hired a tax 
professional (X) in 2019 and X filed her TY 2018 return on an unspecified date . She

planned  to  pay  the  $400  debt  via either her  increased  income  or her anticipated  TY 2019  
refund. She  denied  deliberately disregarding  her tax obligations for TY  2018, to  which  she  
attributed  the  emotional and  financial distress of  her 2016  divorce.  In  her 2020  Answer,  
she  admitted  the  $400  debt  remained  unresolved. In  her 2022  FORM  response, she  
referenced  but did  not  provide, Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS) tax records,  which  she  
asserted  did not   reflect her filing   of TY  2017,  2018, and  2021  returns “through  a  
professional.” She   claimed  she  had  “no  way” to  pay  the  $400  debt because  the  IRS  
records did not reflect  she owed a balance for TY 2018. (Ans; GE 1, 5, 7)  
Applicant proffered the following testimony. She hired X in about 2018 or 2019. X 
filed her TY 2018 return sometime during the summer of 2019. She timely self-filed her 
TY 2019 and 2020 returns. In 2021, upon discovering the IRS rejected her TY 2020 return, 
she hired another tax professional (Y). Y discovered X filed her TY 2018 return incorrectly 
and her TY 2019 and 2020 returns had been rejected due to a “social security number 
issue” with Husband #5’s W-2. After requesting filing extensions for TY 2021 and 2022, 
she “spent many hours” working with Y to “rectif[y] everything.” In about “the beginning of 
[August 2023],” Y filed amended returns for TY 2018 to 2020, and original returns for TY 
2021 and 2022 . “To [her] knowledge,” the $400 debt was paid and she owed no 
outstanding federal or state taxes for TY 2018 through 2022. The SOR did not allege facts 
about late return filings post TY 2018. Accordingly, I will consider them solely to evaluate 
mitigation and the whole -person concept. Despite indicating an intent to do so post 
hearing, she proffered no documents to corroborate the resolution of her TY 2018 tax 
issues. (Ans; GE 1, 5, 7; Tr. at 51-60, 116-117) 
Consumer Debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e through 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l are consumer debts 
totaling $3,037 . Applicant’s March 2020 and April 2021 credit bureau reports ( CBRs) 
reflected all six debts; her December 2021, only SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.k ; and June 2022 
CBR, only SOR ¶ 1.k. None were reflected on her other CBRs. (AE A, B; GE 2-4, 6; Tr. 
at 60-61, 66-68, 70-71) 
During her 2020 SI1, Applicant stated she planned to contact her creditors and pay 
her delinquent debts with her new income. During her 2020 SI2, she stated her attempts 
to contact creditors within the week following her 2020 SI1 were unsuccessful due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In her 2022 FORM response, Applicant asserted she managed her 
debts via a credit bureau agency application (app) for which she paid unspecified 
subscription fees. With information from the app, she paid some debts and successfully 
challenged others. (GE 5, 7) 
In her 2021 Answer, Applicant claimed she resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.c, and 1.e through 
1.g, and was in contact with her creditors to resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l. She testified she 
resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l via lump-sum payments of $892 and $325, respectively. She 
could not recall the amounts she paid to resolve the other debts or the dates of any 
payments. The Government conceded AE B sufficiently corroborated the resolution of 
SOR ¶ 1.e ($58). Despite indicating an intent to do so post hearing, she proffered no 
documents to corroborate payments , disputes, or other efforts to resolve the remaining 
five consumer debts. (Ans; Tr. at 32-33; 60-61, 66-68, 70-71, 114-115, 134-136)

Child-Support Debt. The $15,166 debt in SOR ¶ 1.d stems from Applicant’s 2012 
child-support obligation for her three oldest children. Her March 2020 CBR reflects t he 
alleged amount; and her December 2021 CBR reflects a $11,940 balance. The debt was 
not reported on her other CBRs. (AE A, B; GE 2-4, 6; Tr. at 86) 
Applicant reported the following history. Upon separating from Husband #2 in May 
2007, she relocated to a residence outside of her children’s school district. As a result, 
they resided with Husband #2 more than 50% of the time to attend school . She was “an 
active parent despite the fact that they were with him during the week.” She was neither 
ordered to pay child support pending their divorce nor once it was finalized. Upon being 
awarded joint custody in their 2007 divorce decree , in lieu of child support, the parties 
shared equally, and paid directly, all expenses related to their three children. In addition, 
Husband #2 sent unspecified monthly payments to Applicant for his contribution to the 
extraordinary living expenses she incurred until Child #3 was able to return to childcare. 
Child #3 was born prematurely and suffered ongoing hospitalizations and health issues, 
which rendered him “unable to return to childcare for an extended amount of time.” (GE 
5, 7; Tr. at 34-35, 40-44, 62-66, 89-96) 
Upon  remarrying, Husband  #2  petitioned  the  court for sole custody  (in  about 2009) 
and  child  support (in  about December 2011). The  record did  not address the  custody 
disposition. In  December 2012, the  court ordered  Applicant to  pay, via a  routine  income  
withholding  order (IWO),  beginning  in February 2013: $732  per month  for child  support; 
and $150  per month  for a  $9,516  arrearage  plus accruing  interest until paid  in full. The  
arrearage  dated  back to  the  filing  date  of the  petition. The  court  also  ordered  the  parties 
to  split the  children’s  “health  insurance  costs  50/50.” The  court  denied  Applicant’s request  
for a  deviation  from  the  applicable statutory child  support calculations. (GE 5, 7; Tr. at 34-
35; 40-44, 62-66, 89-96)  
Applicant testified  she  complied  with  the  court’s order via consistent monthly  
payments of about $900  until she  fulfilled  her monthly child-support obligation  and  paid in  
full  the  principal amount of the  arrearage  (on  unspecified  dates).  She  acknowledged  
missing  about three  payments during  unspecified  unemployment, which she  resolved  via  
a  lump-sum  payment of about $3,500,  upon  regaining  employment. She  attributed  SOR  
¶  1.d  solely to  the  interest  balance  of her arrearage  obligation. (Ans;  GE  5, 7; Tr. at,  40-
44, 62-66, 89-96, 154-155)  
Applicant testified she initiated the following actions to resolve SOR ¶ 1.d . To 
secure a waiver of the interest balance, she consulted three attorneys on unspecified 
dates, and her state’s division of child support enforcement (DCSE) in about July 2023 . 
She was advised the only person who can waive the interest balance is Husband #2, and 
he refused. With the DCSE agent’s assistance, on July 1, 2023, Applicant prepared and 
submitted a voluntary Support Agreement, signed by both her and Husband #2, proposing 
a plan to resolve the interest balance through monthly payments of $732 via a new IWO. 
Her existing IWO was to remain in effect until the court approved the plan , which was 
expected about a month post hearing. (Tr. at, 40-44, 62-66, 89-96, 155)

At the hearing, Applicant proffered a partial, unsigned copy of the July 2023 
agreement, which reflected: a $0 child -support balance; a $963 principal arrearage 
balance; and a $6,279 interest balance. She testified the principal balance would be 
imminently resolved via her existing IWO. She planned to resolve the interest balance in 
accordance with the agreement . Despite indicating an intent to do so post hearing, she 
did not provide a full, signed copy of the agreement, indicia of the court’s approval, or any 
documents to corroborate payments beyond those reflected by her December 2021 CBR. 
(AE C; Tr. at, 39, 41, 43-44, 62-66, 89-96, 155) 
The record did not specify Applicant’s other monetary contributions to her six 
children’s expenses. She testified generally, “I make sure they can play sports and make 
sure they have new school shoes for the school year . . . as much as I can;” and 
[regarding  her three  eldest children] I paid for all  travel, all  transportation  expenses.  
I did all the pickup  and  drop-offs. I paid for half of school supplies, half of medical,  
half of sports. I paid all  of the  stuff I was ordered  to  pay, and  more .  . . because  I  
took them school shopping. (Tr. at 64, 173)  
Medical Debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j involve $320 and $420 bills from a hospital and 
private medical provider, respectively, as reflected on Applicant’s March 2020 and April 
2021 CBRs. Neither appeared on her other CBRs. (AE A, B; GE 2-4, 6; Tr. at 68-70, 128) 
On Applicant’s 2020 SCA, she asserted she submitted the bills underlying the 
debts (referencing both creditors by name) to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) and assumed the VA paid them. During her 2020 SI1, she denied knowing the 
specific medical services involved. She did not understand why any medical bills would 
be sent to collections, as she was entitled to full medical coverage through the VA due to 
a service-related disability. She planned to contact the VA to investigate. In her Answer, 
she indicated she was unable to “research” the debts since they no longer appeared on 
her CBR. During the hearing, she indicated she did not intend to pay either debt, while 
acknowledging she had not yet contacted either the VA or the creditors to verify the 
underlying debts had been paid by the VA . Despite indicating an intent to do so post 
hearing, she did not provide any documents to corroborate payments or other efforts to 
resolve the debts. (Ans; GE 1, 5; Tr. at 68-70, 128) 
Federal Student Loans . SOR ¶¶ 1.m through 1.r, totaling $28,462 are U.S. 
Department of Education (USDOE) student loans. Applicant’s March 2020 CBR indicates 
they were either opened or assigned for collection between about 2002 and 2008. None 
were reported on her other CBRs, to which Applicant attributed the age of the debts. (AE 
A, B; GE 2-4, 6; Tr. at 75-76) 
Applicant proffered the following history. She obtained the loans in about April 
2001 while she was on active duty and attending University A. The military paid 75% of 
her University A expenses. She applied the loans to the remaining 25% and 
miscellaneous other expenses she and Husband #2 “needed to pay around the house.” 
As “two lower-end military [members],” their combined income was insufficient to meet 
their necessary expenses, including daycare for two children. Husband #2 agreed to help

repay the loans. However, once they divorced, he refused. Since  the  loans  were opened  
in Applicant’s individual name, they   were  assigned  to  her in their 2007   final divorce   
decree.  She  made  timely monthly payments of  about  $132  in compliance  with  her  
repayment obligation  until 2012, when  she  defaulted due  to her layoff. (GE  5;  Tr.  at  123-
124, 158-159)  
Applicant reported  her loans in delinquent status on  her 2020  SCA, explaining  she  
was “not in  a  position  to  pay  [them] back  yet.” During  her 2020  SI1,  she  proffered  a  plan  
to  contact the  USDOE  to  set up  a  repayment  plan.  When  she  contacted  the  USDOE  within  
the  week following  her  2020  SI1, she  was unable to  do  so  because  of the  pandemic. As  
of her Answer, she  had  not yet arranged  to  repay her loans.  She  attributed  the  delay to  a  
lack of  available  means; initially, due  to not  having  gainful employment;  and  then,  due to  
prioritizing other debts  with her new income. Since  2020, she contacted  the USDOE  one  
time  on  an  unspecified  date  in  2023,  and  was advised  the  loans remained  in deferment  
status due to the pandemic. (Ans; GE 1, 5, 7; Tr. at 71, 129)  
As of the hearing, Applicant had not reached back out to the USDOE , including 
after learning (on an unspecified date) the pandemic deferment would end in September 
2023. She planned to do so post hearing. She did not know the amount of her monthly 
payment obligation beginning in October 2023 , but she was “looking into it. ” S he 
maintained, since becoming gainfully employed, she worked toward establishing a 
repayment plan by attempting to “track down” the current collection company (to no avail 
since the loans had been transferred so many times); and researching information on the 
USDOE website and through her memberships in two financial education groups. (Tr. at 
71-76, 123-132) 
Applicant believed  her  loans were  eligible  for  discharge  through  the  USDOE’s 
Borrower’s Defense   (BD)  program.  Upon  learning  the  BD  program  was  accepting  
applications on  July 31, 2023, she  immediately started  working  on  one, but did  not finalize  
it due  to  University A’s closure for summer and  fall  break. She  planned  to  do  so  post  
hearing  and  continue  “keeping  any eye” out   for other relief programs.  If  she  does  not  
obtain  a  discharge, she  plans to  fulfill  her loan  obligation  through  a  repayment plan. 
Despite  indicating an  intent to  do  so  post hearing, she did not provide  any documents to  
corroborate  any payment history or other efforts to  repay  her USDOE  loans. (Tr. at 71-
76, 123-132)  
Attorney’s  Fees  Debt. SOR ¶  1.s  is a  $21,825  collection  account involving  
Attorney A’s fees for the  custody matter initiated  by Husband  #2, as reflected  on  
Applicant’s April 2021  CBR. It  does not appear on  her other CBRs. (Ans; AE A, B; GE  1-
7; Tr. at 76-77, 94-95, 149-152).  
Applicant reported this debt on her 2020 SCA . She asserted the following during 
her 2020 SI1. She made regular payments of $75 per paycheck to Attorney A , per an 
established agreement, until she became unemployed in June 2018 . She ha d no 
opportunity to contact Attorney A since becoming employed by Sponsor. She planned to 
contact Attorney A to make arrangements to begin repaying her debt with her next

paycheck. However, when she attempted to contact Attorney A within the week following 
her 2020 SI1, she was advised its offices were closed due to the pandemic. (GE 1, 5) 
In her 2021 Answer, Applicant stated she was “working with [a collection company 
(CC1)]” to establish an affordable payment plan. In her 2022 FORM response, she stated 
she contacted CC1 after receiving a copy of the FORM, and was advised the debt had 
been transferred to CC2. She proffered a CC2 statement, dated December 23, 2021 , 
requesting the $21,825 debt be paid in full or via monthly payments of at least $36 . She 
asserted she established a plan with CC2 and made “an initial payment.” (GE 7) 
During the hearing, Applicant acknowledged she prioritized resolving her USDOE 
loans over SOR ¶ 1.s. She proffered the following testimony. She paid Attorney A about 
$100 per month “for a while” until she could no longer afford to do so due to “really 
struggling financially.” Attorney A “tacked on” an unspecified amount to her original bill 
before transferring the debt to CC1. S he paid CC1 about $75 or $100 per month “for a 
while” until her 2012 layoff. Her most recent contact with CC2 was sometime “last year.” 
Since then, the debt had been transferred “twice more.” She planned to “track down” the 
current collection company post hearing to negotiate a settlement. Despite indicating an 
intent to do so, she proffered no documents to corroborate payments or other efforts to 
resolve SOR ¶ 1.s. (Tr. at 76-77, 94-95, 132, 151-152) 
Financial  History  
Applicant reported the following assets as of the hearing : a retirement account 
balance of about $20,000, accumulated since working for Sponsor; “a couple of checking 
accounts through two different banks,” with balances totaling about $1,200; and a savings 
account balance of about $2,000 to $3,000. (Tr. at 79) 
Applicant reported  the following  income  history.  From  December 2010  to  October  
2012  with  Employer A, she  earned  about  $14  to  $16  per hour.  From  October 2014  to  
June  2018  with  Employer B, her annual take-home  pay,  after about $12,000  was  
deducted  for child  support, was about $28,000  as a  trainee, and  “probably $30,000”  as a  
manager.  From  January 2019  to  January 2020  with  Employer C, she  earned  $48,000  
annually, which  was  “40% less” than  her Employer B  salary. She  accepted  the  pay  cut  to  
“get back into  the  field.” From  January 2020  through  present  with  Sponsor, she  has  
earned  an  annual salary, which  increased  from  about $84,000  upon  hire  to  about $98,000  
as of the  hearing, plus bonuses –  “quite  literally the  highest income  I  have  ever made  in  
my life. ” She  did not  receive bonuses in  2020  or 2021  for reasons  unrelated  to  her  
performance. Her March  2022  and  March 2023  net  bonuses  were  about  $6,000  and  
$8,000,  respectively. Her monthly VA  disability pay increased  from  $685  (as  of  an  
unspecified  date)  to  $2,600  (as of  about  late  spring  2022). (Tr. at 20,  31-32,  98, 103, 105-
107)  
Applicant reported the following expense history. She paid: $150 for X’s services 
(Tr. at 55); $250 for “about four hours” of Y’s services in August 2023 (Tr. at 117); $2,500 
cash to Attorney B for the child-support matter initiated by Husband #2 (Tr. at 94); $500 
to $600 per month for gas for her 2005 truck (Tr. at 138); unspecified cash amount to

Attorney C for her divorce from Husband #5 (Tr. at 150); unspecified amount to resolve a 
credit-card account opened sometime after 2014 (GE 5 at 5 -6; GE 3 at 9); unspecified 
amount for a July 2023 cruise to Country X for herself and two eldest sons as a “goodbye 
brother trip” before one son left for the military (Tr. at 80) ; unspecified amount for two 
plane tickets to State Y for herself and eldest daughter so she could “see her [daughter] 
off” as her daughter traveled from State Y to an overseas duty station (Tr. at 81); and an 
unspecified amount for two plane tickets to State Z for herself and one son for his spring 
break trip. (Tr. at 82) She stated she used her bonus for a $4,243 lump-sum cash payment 
to pay off a 2010 car loan in March 2021 , despite earlier stating she received no bonus 
that year. (GE 3 at 9; Tr. at 33, 105-107, 111) 
Applicant added the following context to her expense history. Because she and 
Husband #3 never resided together , they each paid their own living expenses and 
individual debts. Husband #4 paid their living expenses, but not her child support or other 
debts. He told her “living in the house” was “payment of being a stay-at-home mom.” He 
also “refused” to give her gas money , which she paid with her VA disability income. 
Between June 2018 and January 2019, she used her savings to pay for living expenses, 
which she reduced to a “very low” amount by moving to an apartment on an unspecified 
date. (Ans; Tr. at 102) Once she and Husband #5 moved in together in October 2018, he 
began helping with her living expenses, but not her child support or other debts. (Tr. at 
30, 89, 99, 104) From January 2019 to January 2020 , her salary from Employer C was 
“enough for living expenses,” but not sufficient to resume debt repayment. (Ans; Tr. at 33, 
102-104) 
Applicant reported the following ongoing expenses. She pays $498 monthly for the 
sole car she owns. She purchased it in new condition in May 2022 for about $50,000 or 
$60,000, to replace her 2010 car, which was totaled in a November 2021 accident. She 
paid the dealership about $18,000 cash to keep the loan payment “under $500 a month,” 
and financed $28,582 v ia a 72 -month loan. The cash came from her bonus, savings, 
about $2,500 from sale of her 2005 truck, and “just over $5,000” from the accident 
insurance payout. (AE B at 15; GE 6 at 5; Tr. at 20, 78, 138-140) She sends her parents 
about $500 per month “to help them,” because they are in their sixties, and to “try and 
repay them for what they did for me” both monetarily and non-monetarily following her 
2016 divorce. Her parents have never loaned her money. (Tr. at 77 -78) She pays an 
unspecified monthly fee fo r one television streaming service. (Tr. at 81 -82) She pays 
$5.99 monthly for her car’s satellite radio service, pursuant to a three-year contract she 
signed when she purchased her new car, considering it “a pretty good deal.” (Tr. at 82) 
She rarely spends money on restaurant meals due to her dietary restrictions. (Tr. at 81) 
She pays unspecified rent, utilities, and other household expenses for herself and three 
youngest children who reside primarily with her. (GE 1; Tr. at 20, 36, 42 -43, 170, 175) 
She has no ongoing medical costs because the VA “covers all of my medical needs.” (Tr. 
at 156) 
Applicant’s recent CBRs revealed she opened 22 new accounts between April 
2021 and April 2023, including her new car loan, a line of credit, a secured loan, four 
unsecured loans, and 15 credit cards – all reported in good standing. She asserted she 
used the new credit cards solely to pay discretionary expenses. She maintained she

never used them to pay bills or other “necessity” expenses, which she always paid from 
her salary. She explained she opened six of the credit cards, with high credit totaling 
$9,332, to build credit (A); a retail credit card, in April 2023, to purchase herself an Apple-
brand $1,635 touchscreen tablet computer for school (B); an airline credit card , in 
February 2023, with high credit of $3,147, to take advantage of mileage points and other 
benefits when purchasing airline tickets for personal and work use (C); a retail credit card, 
in September 2022, to take advantage of a 55% discount for a $500 purchase related to 
her son’s prom (D); and one retail credit card, in May 2022, to purchase a $4,810 washer 
dryer (E). Her July 2023 CBR reflected b alances of $3,750 (A); $1,423 (B); $3,147 (C), 
which she stated related solely to personal tickets as any work tickets had been fully 
reimbursed; $205 (D); and $4,773 (E). Her credit score increased from 535 to 652 
between her April 2021 and July 2023 CBRs. (AE B; GE 6; Tr. at 137-148; 169-170) 
Applicant testified she does her best to incur new debt only after “a lot of thought” 
and analysis of “all of the facets.” She waited over six months to purchase her new car to 
be “100 percent confident” with her decision. The purchase price of the new car included 
an $8,000 extended warranty , which she felt was necessary to shield her from future 
repair and rental car costs since she is unable to rely on financial assistance from anyone 
else. For those reasons, she chose what she believed was the most reliable car she could 
afford. (GE 7; Tr. at 170, 174-176) 
Debt Resolution  Efforts  
Applicant actively sought a higher paying position to resolve her consumer and 
other delinquent debts, to which she attributed financial instability that began with her 
2007 divorce and continued until she obtained gainful employment in January 2020. She 
lives “a modest life” within her means and has worked hard to improve her financial 
situation. She remains committed to resolving her delinquent debts within her available 
means. She does not intend to incur future indebtedness. (GE 5, 7) 
According to Applicant, her debt resolution efforts were not prompted by the SOR; 
but rather, the timing of her “available income” happened to coincide with the security 
clearance process. She was unable to make progress addressing her delinquent debts 
prior to obtaining gainful employment for various reasons including unemployment, 
underemployment, her child-support obligation, the financial and emotional abuse of her 
marriage to Husband #4, the emotional and financial distresses associated with being a 
single mother and sole provider , and her chronic medical condition and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) . Moreover, she endured high -risk pregnancies with her 
three youngest children (born 2009, 2010, and 2019, respectively), each of which required 
extended bed rest. The bed rest did not impact her financially until the last four months of 
her 2019 pregnancy, when Employer C “halved” her income by reclassifying her 
employee status from salaried to hourly and restricting her to four -hour work days. (Ans; 
GE 1, 5, 7; Tr. at 19-20, 42-46, 152-153, 169) 
Applicant prioritized other financial responsibilities for her family and her child-
support obligation. Given her tenuous relationship with Husband #2, she fear ed jail time 
could be imposed should she fall behind with her child-support payments. She attributed

“the really long time” it took her to accumulate the necessary funds to leave her abusive 
fourth marriage in large part to her child-support debt. Husband #4 ensured she had to 
financially depend solely on him, which he “used” as a “means [of] control.” In 2014, she 
mustered the “courage” and finances (from secretly cleaning houses while he was away 
working) to flee their marital home to escape the abuse. She was in “survival mode” and 
“left with nothing but a laundry basket and my children. And I had to restart my life. I was 
homeless, I was jobless, and I was vehicle-less.” She was able to rebuild her life with the 
help of the financial and emotional support of her parents, a VA program for homeless 
veterans that provided her with vouchers for childcare so she could start working, and “a 
couple years in therapy.” (Ans; GE 1, 5; Tr. at 19-20, 30-31, 42-46, 86-89, 100, 171-172) 
Applicant  learned  about managing  her finances through  a  social  media  group  
called  “Credit 750,”  which she  sought out  to  improve  her credit score, resolve  her  
delinquent  debts, and  buy  a  home.  She  remained  a  member of  the  group  as of  the  
hearing. Her debt repayment plan  involves periodically obtaining  a  new CBR as a  guide  
to  systematically resolve her debts,  one  by one, by using  the  “Dave  Ramsey method” of  
paying  small  debts first, and  then  moving  on  to  the  larger ones. She  maintains a written  
budget  due  to  her  ADHD, which  requires she  write  things down  to  remember  them. She  
considered  engaging  the  services of a  debt resolution  company to  assist in her efforts, 
but decided  against it after speaking  with  a  “couple” of  them, due  to  the  high  fees required.  
She  planned  to  investigate  additional options for financial counseling  and  debt  
management  post hearing. (Tr. at 20, 33, 35,  60-61, 66-68, 70-71, 82-83, 112,  134, 146-
147)  
Applicant testified that, at times, she sought removal of a debt from her CBR 
without making a payment, but she did not indicate any of the SOR debts were resolved 
in that manner. She recalled successfully disputing one debt, but could not recall the date 
of her dispute, the specific debt, or whether the debt was alleged in the SOR. She recalled 
only that it was a debt she viewed on one of her CBRs. None of her CBRs reflect any 
disputes. (AE A; GE 2, 3, 4, 6; Tr. at 61, 68, 110) 
Applicant attributed her inability to provide corroborating documents, beyond those 
indicated above, to “poor recordkeeping,” prioritizing payments over maintaining records 
of payments, and being “very, very, very busy” with “a lot on my plate” as a full -time 
student, full-time employee, and single mother of three young children. She was told by 
one or more creditors that proof of payment was not possible given the age of the debts. 
(Ans; GE 7; Tr. at 35-37, 60-61, 66-68, 70-71, 134-136, 169, 171) 
Whole Person  
Applicant was never terminated or charged with wrongdoing by an employer. She 
has not had disciplinary issues or negative remarks on her performance reviews in 
connection with her current employment. She stated, 
. . . I'm  in a  constant  state  of  improvement and  still  trying  to  overcome  . . .  
what happened  in my past.  It  haunts you  for a  very long  time  unfortunately.  
And  I  am  just  determined  to  make  it  [and]  continue  to  improve  my  life. I'm  at

the best place I've ever been in my entire life. I've never been independent 
like this. (GE 7; Tr. at 146-147, 37) 
Applicant came from a poor family and was never taught about finances or “how 
to be an adult.” She “learned everything in my life by trial and error and educating myself.” 
She is “constantly trying ” to work “ really hard to change my life and overcome the 
circumstances I've dealt with” because “I want my kids to be better than I am . . . They 
deserve way more opportunities than I was ever given in my life.” She believes her career 
“will be hindered” if she is not granted a security clearance because “[i]t is going to 
pigeonhole me into jobs that won't have as much advancement.” (Tr. at 170-173) 
Policies  
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” (Department of the Navy v. Egan , 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” (Egan at 527). 
The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” (EO 10865 § 2) 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such de cisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” (EO 10865 § 
7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has 
not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burde n of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). “Substantial evidence”

is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” (See v. Washington Metro. Area 
Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 
2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigat e the 
facts. (Directive ¶ E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 
at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.” (ISCR Case 
No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials.” (Egan at 531; AG ¶ 2(b)) 
 Analysis 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations  
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trus tworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) 
I, sua sponte , took administrative notice of the following facts from U.S. 
government sources: (1) a government shutdown occurred between about September 30 
and October 17, 2013, but not in 2012 (this discrepancy did not affect the relative positions 
of the parties or my decision); and (2) the USDOE provided emergency relief for federal 
student loans due to the pandemic , including the suspension of loan payments and 
collections on defaulted loans, from March 2020 through September 2023. (AX 1-2)

Defaulting on any loan is security significant, but defaulting on a federal student 
loan is of particular concern when seeking a federal benefit. However, the record 
established Applicant’s student loans were in deferment status due to the USDOE’s 
pandemic relief as of the date of the SOR, and not in delinquent status as alleged. 
Accordingly, I find SOR ¶¶ 1.m through 1.r in Applicant’s favor. Nevertheless, her student 
loans remain relevant to mitigation and the whole-person concept. 
The record evidence and Applicant’s admissions establish the following 
disqualifying conditions set forth in AG ¶ 19 under this guideline as to the remaining non-
student loan allegations: (a) inability to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations; and (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. 
I considered each of the factors set forth in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate the alleged 
concerns under this guideline and find the following warrant discussion: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under  such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur and  does not  cast doubt  
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   
(b) the  conditions  that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely  beyond  
the  person's control  (e.g.,  loss of  employment,  a  business downturn,  
unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death,  divorce  or separation, clear  
victimization  by predatory lending  practices, or identity  theft), and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has received  or is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as  a  non-profit  credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is being  
resolved  or is under control;  
(d) the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   
(e) the  individual has  a  reasonable basis to  dispute  the  legitimacy  of the  
past-due  debt which is the cause of the  problem and provides documented  
proof to  substantiate  the  basis of the  dispute  or provides evidence  of actions  
to resolve the issue; and  
(g) the  individual  has  made  arrangements  with  the  appropriate  tax  authority  
to  file  or pay  the  amount  owed  and  is in compliance  with  those  
arrangements.  
Applicant did not deliberately disregard her TY 2018 federal income tax 
obligations. She presented a reasonable plan in her SCA to resolve her 2018 tax issues, 
and credibly testified about the various responsible actions she took to follow through with 
her plan. The fact that she did not provide evidence to corroborate the resolution of her

2018  tax issues precludes mitigation  based  upon  the  application  of AG ¶¶  20(b), 20(d),  
or 20(g). Given the passage  of time  and  the nature of her 2018 tax issues, I find  SOR ¶¶  
1.a  and 1.b  in her favor based upon  the  application of AG ¶  20(a). I do  not find  sufficient  
evidence  in the  record to  conclude  Applicant’s self-reported  post TY 2018  tax filing  history  
involved  an intentional disregard of her filing  obligations.  
Applicant fulfilled her monthly child -support obligation, and she demonstrated 
meaningful progress toward resolving her arrearage obligation. As of July 2023, she paid 
all but $963 of the principal arrearage and $6,279 of the interest balance . The IWOs 
through which she made payments were not punitive. Based upon her track record of 
payments and responsible actions, I conclude she will follow through with her plan to fully 
resolve her arrearage obligation. By proffering sufficient corroborating documentary 
evidence, she met her burden to establish AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) as to SOR ¶ 1.d, 
which I find in her favor. 
Because Applicant sufficiently corroborated the resolution of her $58 consumer 
debt within a reasonable period of obtaining gainful employment, I find SOR ¶ 1.e in her 
favor based upon the application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d). She proffered a 
reasonable basis to dispute the two medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j. By failing 
to take action to resolve the dispute through the credit bureau agencies or directly with 
her creditors, she did not meet her burden to establish AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(d), or 2 0(e). 
Nevertheless, it is unlikely future medical debts will arise. Given the amounts involved 
and nature of the debts, I find SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j in her favor based upon the application 
of AG ¶ 20(a). 
Conversely, Applicant failed to sufficiently corroborate payments with documentary 
evidence or otherwise demonstrate meaningful progress in resolving her remaining 
indebtedness. I considered the challenges of accessing certain financial documents due 
to the age of the debts. However, that does not relieve her of the obligation to substantiate 
her mitigation claims. The Appeal Board has previously noted it is reasonable for a judge 
to expect applicants to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, 
e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). The mere disappearance of 
a debt from a credit report does not establish it was paid or otherwise resolved. The CC2 
statement confirms her December 2021 contact with CC2 but does not establish either 
an agreed payment plan or payments toward resolving SOR ¶ 1.s. 
Applicant’s unresolved consumer debts totaling less than $3,000 are not of security 
significance alone. Were it not for the substantial amount involved, the attorney’s fees 
resulting from circumstances beyond her control might lack security significance. 
However, I am unable to view these two debts either in isolation from the other or the 
record as a whole. She failed to meet her burden to establish payment or other resolution 
of these debts. Similarly, she failed to demonstrate a meaningful track record of regular 
and timely payments for a significant federal loan obligation. The deferred status of her 
loans from March 2020 through September 2023 resulted from the USDOE’s pandemic 
relief, not to any demonstrated action on her part. The record did not indicate whether 
she applied for, or received, any deferments while enrolled at University B. The pandemic 
relief and circumstances beyond her control provide some mitigation as to her periods of 
15 
 
 
 
      
         
     
       
         
   
 
     
           
       
          
          
       
        
            
        
        
    
      
  
 
         
       
            
      
          
          
           
           
          
       
    
 
 
     
       
         
          
          
 
 
nonpayment between her 2007 divorce through September 2023 , including her 
nonpayment between January 2020 and March 2020 , which was reasonable given the 
recency of her employment and new income. Nevertheless, neither the extent to which 
she has been temporarily absolved from making payments nor the possibility of a 
successful discharge at some point in the future obviates her responsibility to USDOE for 
student loans dating back to the early 2000s. 
Security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection proceedings. The AGs do 
not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay every debt alleged in the SOR, to 
be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the SOR. An applicant needs onl y to 
establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement 
the plan. She proffered a reasonable plan to resolve her remaining indebtedness. 
However, d espite nearly doubling her salaried income and quadrupling her disabili ty 
income, she failed to demonstrate meaningful progress in following through with that plan. 
In the last two years, she opened 22 new accounts and demonstrated questionable 
judgment in her discretionary spending . She had not yet finalized either her BD 
application or lined up a viable repayment option for her student loans despite the 
imminent end of the pandemic deferment. Promises, however sincere, are not a substitute 
for a corroborated track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting 
in a financially responsible manner. 
The efforts Applicant made to address her tax issues, child support, and a single 
consumer debt are steps in the right direction. She is to be commended for taking 
proactive actions to improve her finances and create a better life for herself and her 
children, despite extraordinary challenges. However, although she raised the potential 
applicability of one or more mitigating conditions as to the remaining five consumer debts 
and attorney’s fee debt, she failed to meet her burdens of production and persuasion to 
establish mitigation of the Guideline F con cerns. While she may be able to overcome 
these concerns at some future date, based upo n the existing record, I am unable to 
conclude her indebtedness is not likely to recur and no longer casts doubt on her 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) through (e) have not been 
established as to SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k and 1.l, and 1.s. 
Whole-Person Analysis  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of th e 
adjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole 
person. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors 
listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  
16 
 
 
 
 
       
      
      
      
  
     
      
      
 
 
 
      
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
     
  
 
 
 
 
and  other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  for the  conduct;  
(8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  (9) the  
likelihood  of continuation or recurrence.  
I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, 
and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). The lack of corroborating documentation 
and her failure to avail herself of the opportunity to expand the record with respect to her 
debt resolution efforts after the hearing under mined mitigation. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence 
in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by her indebtedness. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried 
her burden of showing it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant 
her eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a  –  1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph  1.c:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f  –  1.g:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph  1.h:   Withdrawn by the Government 
Subparagraphs 1.i  –  1.j:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k –  1.l:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m  –  1.r:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph  1.s:   Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to 
grant Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
