amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on 
June 8, 2017. 
On March 11, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a 
hearing. The Government was ready to proceed on May 2, 2022. The case was assigned 
to me on February 16, 2023 . On April 1 3, 2023 , the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant his hearing was scheduled for May 31 , 2023 , via 
videoconference. On May 30, 2023, the hearing was rescheduled to June 16, 2023, for 
good cause. The hearing was convened in person on the rescheduled date. 
Applicant and two witnesses testified . Without objection, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A 
through C, and Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, were admitted in evidence. GE 3 and 
4 were admitted in evidence over Applicant’s objection . An administrative letter was 
appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Without objection, I took administrative 
notice of facts set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th 
Edition (DSM -5) sections on Schizophreniform Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar I 
Disorder, as requested by the Government, and appended them to the record as 
Administrative Exhibits (AX) I and II. Applicant declined the invitation for post-hearing 
submissions and the record closed upon the adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received 
the transcript (Tr.) on June 30, 2023. 
Post-Hearing Matters  
On September 19, 2023, the Government requested I reopen the record and take 
administrative notice of facts concerning the political conditions in the People’s Republic 
of China (PRC or China), extracted from official U.S. Government publications (Source 
Documents) (AX III) . I afforded the parties reasonable notice and an opportunity to 
respond. For good cause and over Applicant’s objection, I reopened the record, took 
administrative notice as requested, and appended AX III to the record . The record re-
closed on November 8, 2023. 
On December 31, 2024, I provided the parties reasonable notice and an 
opportunity to respond to my intent to, sua sponte , reopen the record and take 
administrative notice of facts in the four updated AX III Source Documents (collectively 
AX IV) listed below, to consider the current political conditions in the PRC. For good cause 
and without objection, I reopened the record, took administrative notice as stated, and 
appended AX IV to the record. The record re-closed on January 14, 2025.

The facts in AX I through V taken under administrative notice will not be repeated 
verbatim in this decision, but will instead be referenced or summarized, as appropriate. 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant, age 30, is a Chinese citizen by birth . In 2010, h e immigrated to the 
United States alone on a student visa. He resided in two states before settling in State A 
in 2012. He earned his high school diploma in 2016. He took college courses from 2017 
to 2019, without earning a degree. By his own application, he became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen in 2019. He has been employed as an automation engineer by his sponsor since 
February 2021. This is his first application for a security clearance. (GE1; Tr. at 41 -52, 
97-99) 
In December 2016, Applicant relocated to State B for employment. In December 
2019, he relocated back to State A. Since then, he has resided with his parents (both age

54) and  his sole  sibling  (age  16)  in his family’s home  in State  A. His parents and  sister,  
who  are also Chinese  citizens by birth, immigrated  to  the  United  States in about 2015.  
During  his March 2021  security clearance  interview  (2021  SI), Applicant  reported  his  
father  and  sister  as naturalized  U.S.  citizens and  his mother  as  a  permanent  U.S. resident  
petitioning for U.S. citizenship. (GE 1, 2; GE  3 at 12; Tr. at 5, 20-23,  92, 101-105)  
Applicant worked in various information technology (IT) positions , including : 
Consulting Company X, from December 2012 to December 2016 ; Consulting Company 
Y from December 2016 to June 2018, when he transitioned to a direct position with a 
client; and Consulting Company X, from December 2019 to February 2020. He remained 
unemployed until February 2021. (GE 1, 2; Tr. at 101-105) 
Guideline I  
Applicant experienced a psychotic episode for about four or five months, beginning 
in May 2020 , which exhibited characteristics such as: decline in mental functioning; 
sustained persecutory delusions, confusion, disorganized thought process and behavior, 
labile affect, auditory hallucinations, severely impaired reality testing , selective mutism, 
and paranoia; persisting beliefs in his supernatural abilities to communicate telepathically 
with animals; persisting grandiose delusions of being part of a complex international 
cooperation between the Uygur and American governments; dense complex delusion 
with significant functional effect; poor judgment ; cannabis abuse; and ant i-social traits. 
He was involuntarily hospitalized three times between May and August 2020 . He was 
arrested for assaulting his father in September 2020. (GE 3 at 2-4, 10, 12, 14, 26-30, 33, 
34, 37-38, 44-45, 47-49, 56, 59, 83; GE 4) 
Applicant began  voluntary outpatient treatment at  a  community  mental health  
program  (Program  X)  in June  2020. His treating  psychiatrist (TP) diagnosed  him, in  
accordance  with  DSM-5, with  Schizophreniform  Disorder, acute  schizophrenic episode  
(295.40) and  “Cannabis use  disorder,  Mild” (305.20), in  June  2020; and  Bipolar I  Disorder, 
current or  most recent  episode  manic, severe  (296.43), in  December  2020. (GE  3  at 15,  
59, 77, 82-83, 85, 88)  
Hospitalizations. From  May 24  to  26, 2020, law enforcement transported  Applicant  
twice to  the  emergency room  (ER)  for assessment,  on  a  voluntary basis, following  
incidents  of concerning  behavior. Noting  no  risk issues, he  was released  from  his first ER 
visit  on  a  safety plan, with  a  recommendation  to  follow up  with  outpatient services. After  
exhibiting  disturbing  behavior  during  his second  ER visit,  he was  admitted  involuntarily to  
Hospital A. At a commitment  hearing  on  May 27, 2020,  he  consented  to  a  voluntary 
admission. In  Hospital A, he  tested  positive for cannabis, and  was prescribed  an  
antipsychotic and  a  mood  stabilizer. Because  he  chose  to  leave  against  medical advice  
on June  8, 2020, he  was discharged without medication. (GE  3 at 2, 10, 11)  
On June 9, 2020, following an incident of alarming behavior (including telling his 
family he needed to die or he might kill some people) , law enforcement transported 
Applicant to the ER for assessment, and he was subsequently admitted involuntarily to 
Hospital B. At a commitment hearing on June 11, 2020, he consented to a voluntary

admission. In Hospital B, he reported he believed he was being tracked by the Chinese 
and U .S. governments and was involved in a spy ring with code name X [which he 
reported as an alias on his 2021 SCA] . He was prescribed an antipsychotic while 
hospitalized and provided a 14-day supply upon his discharge on June 17, 2020. (GE 1 
at 8; GE 3 at 3, 11) 
On June 27, 2020, Applicant was either voluntarily or involuntarily hospitalized at 
Hospital A, based, in part, on suicidal ideations he later claimed he fabricated because 
“he needed to be heard by a professional and make himself a sacrifice to help his people 
who are in concentration camps.” On July 3, 2020, he transitioned, through a step-down 
process, to a local crisis care program (CCP) for voluntary outpatient treatment. In CCP, 
he took prescribed medications (an antipsychotic and antidepressant) without incident. 
On July 6, 2020, he left CCP against medical advice, with after-care recommendations to 
continue treatment and taking prescribed medications. (Answer; GE 3 at 19 -22, 24-26; 
Tr. at 159-160) 
On August 17, 2020, Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized at Hospital C in State 
B, after he was found wandering in an airport and exhibiting disconcerting behavior. He 
was discharged on August 27, 2020 , and he returned to State A on August 29, 2020 . 
During his psychotic episode, he travelled impulsively and excessively, and accumulated 
debt totaling $75,000. (GE 3 at 34, 35, 38, 43, 47, 61, 72, 75, 83) 
Assault. On September 2, 2020, law enforcement transported Applicant to  the  ER  
for assessment after he  assaulted  his father during  an  argument about money. As he  did  
not meet  the  criteria  for involuntary commitment,  he  was released  back to  law  
enforcement,  who  transported  him  to  jail, where he  was arrested  and  charged  with  
misdemeanor assault on  a  family member. He  was assigned  a  probation  officer,  to  whom  
he  reported  regularly in connection  with  the  assault charge. The  record did not indicate  
the  duration  or status of his probation. He maintained,  without proffering  corroborating  
documentation, the  charge  was dismissed. He testified  that records pertaining  to  the  
charge  had  been  expunged  pursuant to  a  court order, which  he  corroborated  via  a  letter  
dated  January 10, 2023. (Answer; AE  C at  6;  GE  3  at 39, 41, 43-44, 49, 56, 68-69, 80;  
Tr. at 26-27, 73-74, 108, 111-114, 142-143)  
Program  X  Records. In  June  2020, Applicant  began  voluntary outpatient treatment 
via a coordinated  special care  program  called  “First Episode  Psychosis track.”  He  had  12  
sessions with  TP in 2020  and  three  in 2021. He attended  weekly or bi-weekly therapy  
sessions, from  about June  through  November 2020, and  January through  March 2021.  
Ms. V, a  licensed  clinic  social worker, and  Ms. W, a  licensed mental health  professional,  
worked closely with TP in his care. From  June 2020  to  February 2021, TP assessed  him  
as an  unreliable narrator  with  poor insight into  his  mental illness, manipulative  behavior, 
disinterest  in treatment, and  persistent  denial of his clinical condition.  (GE 3  at 3, 5, 8, 11,  
29, 32, 43, 47-49, 68, 69, 70, 74-75, 78-81, 85-89)  
TP formally diagnosed the Schizophreniform and Cannabis Use Disorders on June 
27, 2020. TP raised the possibility of Bipolar I Disorder during his initial assessment, but 
did not formally diagnose it until December 16, 2020. TP prescribed medications to

address Applicant’s Schizophreniform and Bipolar I Disorders, but not his Cannabis Use 
Disorder. (GE 3 at 11-16, 26-37, 43-66, 71-73, 75-77, 82-84) 
From June 26 to August 5, 2020, TP prescribed Applicant an oral antipsychotic 
(RX 1) to be taken at various intervals and in doses ranging from 10 mg to 30 mg. TP had 
difficulty determining the effectiveness of RX 1 because he took it “very sporadically” and 
was an unreliable reporter. On August 5, 2020, TP noted he was not substantially 
engaged in his treatment plan . On August 26, 2020, TP modified his prescription to a 
monthly 156 mg injectable antipsychotic (RX 2 injection) and a nighttime 10 mg dose of 
RX 1. On September 4, 2020, TP noted, “After several months of sustained active 
treatment with sustained compliance, we will be able to draw more reliable conclusions 
diagnostically.” (GE 3 at 16, 27, 30, 34, 37, 45) 
TP assessed Applicant’s Schizophreniform Disorder “improved,” on September 
23, 2020, noting, “Superficially, thought process . . . and judgment has improved since 
two weeks ago; likely due to medication compliance and loss of income;” and “significantly 
improved,” beginning on September 30, 2020. On September 30, 2020, TP lowered the 
dose of RX 1, due to excessive sedation. On October 21, 2020, TP assessed his 
Schizophreniform Disorder for the last time, noting a “dramatic and substantial 
improvement” in symptoms, attributable to “some or all” of the following: compliance with 
prescribed medications, legal consequences of his assault charge, and the end of “the 
natural course of a five-month manic episode.” TP noted, 
The abrupt, discrete, and exhaustive loss/recovery of himself and his 
function fits more with bipolar disorder. He is not demonstrating a persisting 
thought disorder and impaired reality testing that is causing a progressive 
downward drift. I strongly recommend continuing [the RX 2 injection] for at 
least another year at least, even if he has bipolar disorder. (GE 3 at 55-56) 
TP assessed Applicant’s Bipolar I Disorder as “significantly improved,” beginning 
November 18, 2020, and noted: 
In my opinion, there are two possibilities diagnostically: 
1) he  has bipolar  disorder; he  experienced  a  very long, very severe  
psychotic episode, (four months) that  resolved  in October [2020] because  
of the  natural  course,  the  sustained  [RX  2  injections],  and  the  severe  
consequences.  He  is  currently testing  the  course of his symptoms by 
stopping  meds. His presentation  clinically during  his illness fits  better  with  a  
mixed, manic episode.  
The inter-episodic recovery that we believed he is having right now, seems 
to be limited. He is not clinically depressed, but he is not functioning at his 
pre-morbid level. If he is suffering from bipolar disorder, and he is entering 
a second episode, he has a poor prognosis.

2) he  has schizophrenia and  he  has been  able to  hide  the  persecutory  
delusions, or they have  improved  with  treatment,  and  they will  re-emerge. If  
he  is experiencing  a  sustained  psychotic illness, he  responded  to  it in a  
grandiose  and  manic fashion. He does  not have  a  prominent formal thought  
disorder.  
In either case, the recommendation is clear: he needs to remain on [RX 2], 
and it should be injectable because he is not a reliable patient. 
TP also recommended adding a 6 mg oral dose of RX 2 as a “fall back” in case of a 
sudden onset of psychosis. Applicant objected to adding the oral dose of RX 2 , and 
requested to cease the RX 2 injection, because he did not need them. He reported feeling 
more alert since stopp ing RX 1 (on an unspecified date), and that he believed stopping 
the RX 2 injection would make him “feel more energetic.” (GE 3 at 57, 59) 
On December 2, 2020, TP agreed to lower Applicant’s RX 2 injection dose by half 
over the next two months: 78 mg in December 2020 and 39 mg in January 2021, after 
assessing his Bipolar I Disorder as follows: 
[He is] struggling  with  the  consequences of extended  manic episode, has  
been  trying  to  stop  all  medications, (because  he  thinks  he  can  control his 
mania  with  will  power)  but  is willing  to  negotiate,  when  his mother applies  
pressure  . . . He does not currently have  any manic or psychotic symptoms, 
and has not exhibited any since  [September] 2 020  . .  . He had  been  taking  
[the  RX 2  injection] monthly for three  months  . . .  He is capable  of making  
medication  decisions at this time, despite  the  fact that his argument  relies 
on blatant denial of the past six months  . . .   (GE 3  at 61, 63)  
Applicant stopped the RX 2 injection after taking the 156 mg dose on November 
25, 2020. On December 16, 2020, TP noted he had “no signs of developing insight” about 
his Bipolar I Disorder,” which he assessed as follows: 
[He is] treatment ambivalent - he appears to be engaged as a means to 
gratify his [mother] and the courts - but not meaningfully . . . still insists on 
stopping the [RX 2 injection] and [RX 1] because he does not believe he 
has a mental illness . . . no signs of an impending episode . . . four-month 
period (4/2020 - 8/2020) of sustained psychosis , impulsivity, persecutory 
delusions . . . but it ended. He has returned to baseline level of thinking, 
feeling, acting - after he was medicated with [RX 2 injection ] for three 
months, (8/2020 - 11/2020) . . . (GE 3 at 61, 64, 66, 72-73, 77, 84) 
In a December 17, 2020 “Service Plan Review,” Ms. V noted: 
[He] is recommended  to  continue  engag[ing]  in services  . .  . to  continue  
working  in  individual therapy  for  processing  the  episode  of  psychosis he  
experienced,  symptom  monitoring  to  prevent  relapse  episode  . . . [ he] is

recommended to continue engag[ing] in medication management services 
even though his plan is to discontinue the medication . . . (GE 3 at 68) 
On January 13, 2021, TP noted, “no evidence of cannabis abuse,” and assessed 
Applicant’s Bipolar I Disorder as “clinically stable since September 2020” with “No signs 
of mania or psychosis . N o thought disorder or residual paranoia .” TP also noted, “he 
understands the rationale [for continuing medications] for maintenance/prophylaxis but 
does not recognize the need.” On February 24, 2021, TP noted: 
He has  missed  several appointments with  [Ms. W]  over the  course  of the  
past two  months .  . . has expressed  uncertainty about the  ongoing  need  for  
treatment  .  .  .  has  not  had  [medications] since  Thanksgiving  2020  and  has  
not been  meaningfully engaged  since  that  time  . . . has not had  . . .  
symptoms, or interest  in treatment since  Thanksgiving  2020. It  is not  
uncommon  for  individuals with  Bipolar  Disorder to  dismiss the  seriousness  
of their  first,  (few)  episodes.  He  is at substantial  risk of  relapse,  but  it is  
impossible  to  predict the  course of his illness at this point  .  . .  his lack of  
interest  or insight  limits  the  benefit that  he  will  obtain  from  treatment, and  is  
not a  threat to  himself or the  community at this time  from  illness. He  could  
potentially benefit  from  outpatient  treatment to  better manage  his  illness,  
but it is not medically necessary.  (GE 3  at 71, 73, 75, 77)  
On March 24, 2021, the last session reflected in Program X records, TP noted: 
[Applicant]  has not  attended  the  outpatient  therapy appointments since  
November 2020  - but he  has developed  a  renewed  interest  since  he  was  
given  a  court date  in April [2020] . . . was unexpectedly eager to  participate  
in treatment given  his prolonged  indifference  and  denial  . . . engagement in  
treatment is sporadic  at best  - now he  is motivated  . . .  has  been  better able  
to  acknowledge  the  severity of  [his  psychotic episode]  - but he  cannot grasp  
the  potential recurrence. (GE 3 at  82, 84)  
Ms. W   updated  Applicant’s “Service  Plan” on  March  18,  2021,  for proposed  
continued  treatment from  March  21  to  June  19, 2021, noting, his status  would  be  
“continuously evaluated  and  discussion  will  be  held around  current needs, progress made  
towards goals,  and  transition/discharge  planning.” He reported  he  would  be  ready for  
discharge  when  he  secures a  full-time  position  in his field of interest  and  resolves  
outstanding  court issues. During  a  quarterly review on  April 15, 2021,  covering  the  period  
December 21, 2020  to  March 21, 2021, he  reported  that he  “never”  took his medication  
as prescribed; and  that he  prepared  a  written  relapse  plan  and  shared  it with  others (a  
copy of which was not proffered  for the record). (GE 3  at 78, 80-81, 85-86)  
DSM-5. According  to  DSM-5, both  Schizophreniform  and  Bipolar I (manic)  
Disorders include  the  similar diagnostic criterion  regarding  the  impact of substance  
abuse: disturbance/episode  is “not attributable  to  the  physiological effects  of  a  substance”  
(e.g.,  a  drug  of abuse  or medication).”  Regarding  Bipolar 1  Disorder, 1) “[m]ore than  90%  
of individuals who  have  a  single manic episode  go  on  to  have  recurrent mood  episodes;”

and “After an individual has a manic episode with psychotic features, subsequent manic 
episodes are more likely to include psychotic features.” Regarding Schizophreniform 
Disorder: 1) characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those 
of schizophrenia, except as to the duration of the symptoms; 2) the duration requirement 
for schizophreniform disorder is between one and six months, while schizophrenia is more 
than six months; and 3) “[a]bout one -third of individuals with an initial diagnosis of 
schizophreniform disorder” recover within the six-month period and schizophreniform 
disorder is their final diagnosis, while the “majority of the remaining two-thirds of 
individuals” will eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schi zoaffective 
disorder. (AE I at 124, 130; AE II at 97, 98) 
SOR Allegations. Applicant disputed  all  three  diagnoses on  the  basis that TP  
incorrectly assessed  his symptoms,  which  he  denied  resulted  from  any  psychiatric  
disorders. He attributed  his psychotic episode  to  “just stress, regular stress” associated   
with  his 2019  relocation  from  State  B  to  State  A  and  loss of  his grandmother, the  COVID-
19  pandemic, and  pandemic-related  unemployment. His mother testified  that, despite  
placing  her “trust” in his doctors at the  time, in hindsight,  she  similarly attributed  his  
psychotic episode  to  “regular stress” and  disagreed  with  the  diagnoses. (Answer; GE  2  
at 3; Tr. at 17-18, 36-37, 140, 145)  
Applicant asserted he continued taking the RX 2 Injection, as prescribed, through 
his January 2021 dose (which his mother corroborated), after which he stopped taking all 
medications, with the approval of his treatment providers. He characterized his 
compliance with taking his prescribed medications as involuntary, which his mother 
corroborated. He described his providers physically open ing his mouth to insert oral 
medication, to which he attributed his acquiescence to the injectable form of RX 2. He 
believed his medication compliance “was the only way out” to ensure he would be able to 
discharge from Program X and ease his parents’ worries. He stated he never took 
medications prior to his psychotic episode, had no desire to resume taking medication s, 
and felt much better since he stopped. He believed he never needed medication and 
never had a “brain problem.” He attributed his diagnoses and prescribed medications to 
the power imbalance and profit-driven focus of drug manufacturers and the medical 
industry, stating, “They see a perfectly groomed man . . . they're trying to do everything 
that they can . . . to prove that I have some problem.” (Answer; GE 2 at 3; Tr. at 17 -19, 
23-24, 34-37, 66-68, 81-83, 115-116, 143, 145) 
Applicant maintained  that,  despite  having  the  choice to  discharge  himself from  
Program  X  (on  a  date  not specified), he  chose  to  continue  treatment, about twice a  week,  
until his discharge  on  April 11, 2022. He provided  a  document meant to  corroborate  the  
discharge, but it did  not. Through  Program  X,  he  learned  about his “disorders,”  and  ways 
to  “cope,” stay on   “track,”  control his behaviors, and  manage  symptoms without  
medication. He  stated  he  was  “one  of  [Program X’s]   role  models,” due  to  his  quick  
recovery and  return to  gainful employment.  (Answer; AE  D; GE  2  at 3; Tr. at 36- 37, 66-
67, 74-76, 78-81, 86, 117,  122)  
In  his Answer,  without corroborating  evidence, Applicant  referenced  the  following  
quote  from  a  note  purportedly made  by TP   on  September 22, 2021:   “He  has been

asymptomatic for 11 months off of [medications]. His psychiatric symptoms have been in 
complete sustained remissions without [medications] for 11 months.” He stated he was 
“agreeable to work on relapse prevention planning.” At the hearing, he reiterated he was 
fully recovered and was no longer experiencing any symptoms, which his mother and 
sister corroborated. He acknowledged he neither sought treatment nor engaged in 
therapy since April 2022, as he did not believe it was necessary . Neither party proffered 
a recent opinion from a duly qualified mental health professional. (Answer; Tr. at 17-19, 
23-24, 34-37, 66-68, 81-83, 115-116, 122, 135, 154, 163-164) 
Guideline H  
Applicant was treated for cannabis use disorder at Program X. He started smoking 
marijuana at age 15, when he first arrived in the United States , and had been using 
marijuana with a frequency of about “a few times” or “one to two times” per week in the 
“couple of years” prior to the onset of his psychotic episode. (GE 3 at 3, 5, 15, 17, 21-22, 
24-25) 
Applicant actively used cannabis on a regular basis from at least June 26 through 
September 4, 2020. From June 26 to July 29, 2020, he reported he did not intend to stop 
using cannabis and “sees no difficulties related to it .” On September 4, 2020, TP noted, 
“he has been abusing cannabis heavily for an unknown period of time. Up to this point, 
he has been pre -contemplative in all areas involving change.” On September 23, 2020, 
TP noted he “minimized drug use utterly,” and recommended he be drug tested as part 
of his probation. On October 21, 2020, TP noted he “should be tested routinely” by his 
probation officer. On November 18, 2020, he self-reported he was “clean,” but TP was 
not able to confirm via urinalysis results. On December 2, 2020, TP noted, “I suspect that 
[Applicant] continues to use . . . He should be drug tested randomly by [Program X].” (GE 
3 at 12, 28, 29, 31, 34, 35, 37, 45, 47, 49, 56, 59, 61, 63) 
TP noted Applicant’s “cannabis abuse” plan as “monitor,” “surveillance,” 
“unknown,” on December 16, 2020, February 24 and March 24, 2021, respectively. TP 
assessed Applicant’s cannabis use disorder as: “stable,” beginning September 4, 2020; 
“significantly improved,” beginning October 21, 2020, “improved,” beginning November 
18, 2020; “significantly improved,” beginning January 27, 2021; and “stable,” beginning 
February 24, 2021 . The records do not reflect TP or any other provider proffered a 
prognosis. (GE 3 at 35, 56, 59, 66, 73, 77, 84) 
Applicant did not disclose his marijuana use, cannabis use disorder diagnosis, or 
cannabis abuse treatment on his 2021 SCA, as discussed further below, or during his 
2021 SI. In his 2022 Answer, he admitted he used marijuana from March 2019 to August 
2020 with a frequency of “not very often (once a month).” He asserted he disagreed with 
the diagnosis because “I wasn’t a daily smoker, and I was able to perform my daily tasks.” 
He denied he “continued to use marijuana despite being diagnosed with cannabis abuse 
disorder,” (SOR ¶ 2.c) stating, “I continued to use CBD, but not the THC because I know 
lots of people benefit from CBD . I used CBD that may contain a little amount of THC so 
my drug test showed that it was positive for THC in August 2020.” He did not proffer any 
evidence to specify or corroborate the amount of THC present in any of the CBD he used,

nor was it otherwise indicated in the record. He denied he “intend[ed] to continue to use 
Marijuana in the future” (SOR ¶ 2.d). He asserted, “I have stopped use of THC now and 
do not intend to use in the future,” and attached evidence of a negative result on a 
September 2021 pre -employment drug test for marijuana and other illegal drugs. 
(Answer; AE A) 
During the hearing, Applicant repeatedly denied he ever used illegal marijuana. He 
distinguished CBD use from marijuana use. He indicated he understood the use of 
marijuana was illegal under federal law . He testified that his references to marijuana in 
his Answer related solely to his legal use of CBD. He acknowledged he used CBD 
“probably every single day during [the] pandemic” because he was bored. He indicated 
he primarily smoked CBD but may have also used it in edible form. He claimed he only 
used CBD he purchased legally from “smoke shops.” He denied he ever knowingly 
purchased CBD containing THC. He maintained he carefully read labels to ensure he 
only purchased CBD that did not contain THC, while also acknowledging he “probably by 
accident” used CBD that contained THC in quantities he estimated as “couple 
percentage, .1 or [.]2, but I don't know.” (Tr. at 61-65, 79-81, 124-125) 
Applicant believed he was misdiagnosed with “cannabis abuse.” He initially 
attributed the diagnosis to his deliberate consumption of marijuana in edible form while 
he was on a trip in State C (on dates not specified in the record). He did not indicate the 
amount or frequency of his consumption during the trip . He stated, “some edibles can 
. . . trip you up for a . . . long, long time.” He later attributed the diagnosis to his use of 
CBD. He denied he used cannabis regularly, abused cannabis heavily, or used cannabis 
by vape daily, as noted by TP on August 5 and September 4, 2020. He suggested TP 
may have obtained that information from his parents, despite TP’s notes indicating the 
information was obtained from him. (Tr. at 61-63, 79-81) 
Applicant asserted he stopped his legal use of CBD due to construing his 
“cannabis abuse” diagnosis as a sign that CBD use could be harmful (without specifying 
the date of his last use). He recalled TP warned him of the harm associated with his CBD 
use and advised him to stop using CBD. He later testified, “I just want to confess that I 
have not touched [CBD] since after I got discharged [from Program X] in April [2022].” He 
attributed his CBD use to stress . He described various stress management techniques 
he implemented since he stopped using CBD, including caring for his cat and managing 
his 100 gallon fish tank. (Tr. at 64; 126, 136, 167) 
Applicant’s mother testified she never observed Applicant use marijuana or 
smelled it emanating in their shared home; rather, she smelled it emanating from his car 
at unspecified times between about July and December 2020. His sister testified she had 
“never seen [him] smoke marijuana,” but she smelled it emanating in their shared home 
at unspecified times. She attributed the smell solely to Applicant. His mother and sister 
both testified he stopped smoking marijuana, without specifying the date of his last use . 
He claimed they were smelling CBD, and not marijuana. (Tr. at 137-139, 163, 167)

Guideline E  
In Applicant’s 2022 Answer, he responded “I admit” in response to each of the 
Guideline E falsification allegations , which involved his responses to questions on his 
2021 SCA about his psychological and emotional health (section 21), police record 
(section 22), and illegal use of drugs or drug activity (section 23). (Answer) However, he 
otherwise denied the admitted falsifications were deliberate. 
Section 21 . Applicant responded “no” to “Has a court or administrative agency 
EVER issued an order declaring you mentally incompetent” (SOR ¶ 3.a); and “Has a court 
or administrative agency EVER ordered you to consult with a mental health professional 
. . .” (SOR ¶ 3.b). He responded “Yes” to “Have you EVER been hospitalized for a mental 
health condition.” (SOR ¶ 3.c). He disclosed he was voluntarily “hospitalized due to my 
mental health problem” from about June 2020 to August 2020, and identified the address 
and location of the service provider for Program X. (GE 3) 
Applicant also responded negatively to two other questions that were not alleged 
in the SOR: “Do you have an additional instance where you have EVER been hospitalized 
for a mental health condition; ” and “Have you EVER been diagnosed by a physician or 
other health professional . . . with psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar mood disorder, borderline personality disorder, or 
antisocial personality disorder.” (GE 1) 
During  Applicant’s 2021  SI, he acknowledged  he  had  been  diagnosed  with  a bi-
polar mood  disorder  by a  doctor he  could  not recall, who  referred  him  to  the  service  
provider for Program  X  for additional aid.  He  did not  specifically address his responses  in  
section  21, but he  attributed  any inaccuracies on  his SCA  about his psychological and  
emotional health  to  oversight. (GE 2)  
Regarding SOR ¶ 3.a, Applicant admitted in his Answer that a court issued “an 
order declaring me mentally incompetent” in 2019. He asserted he “misread the question” 
at the time of his SCA response. He stated, “I thought the question was asking if I was 
currently mentally incompetent which I believe [d] was false.” At the hearing, he 
maintained his “no” response was correct because he believed the order declaring him 
mentally incompetent was “performative.” (Answer; Tr. at 85) 
Regarding SOR ¶ 3.b, Applicant admitted in his Answer that a court or 
administrative agency “ordered me to consult with a mental health professional.” While 
he did not specially address his negative SCA response, he indicated he “wasn’t clear 
about how everything worked.” He explained he was unconscious when he was brought 
to Hospital A. He stated that, only after working with Program X, did he “[come] to an 
understanding of what happened.” At the hearing, he maintained his “no” response was 
correct based on “my knowledge, my understanding, at that time . . . .” (Answer; Tr. at 86) 
Regarding SOR ¶ 3.c, Applicant stated in his Answer , “At the time of [ my] 
hospitalization, I believe I went in for voluntary treatment. Then I found I was there for 
12 
 
 
 
      
      
 
 
        
           
            
        
      
     
 
           
          
        
   
 
       
  
   
 
         
  
 
 
 
       
  
 
   
 
      
           
     
       
      
 
 
         
  
     
involuntary hospitalization. I wasn't clear with how everything worked and the mental 
health system.” He did not address SOR ¶ 3.c during the hearing. (Answer; GE 2) 
Section  22. Applicant responded  “no” to  whether  he  had, “In the  last seven (7)  
years,” been  “arrested  by any police  officer, sheriff, marshal, or any other type   of  law  
enforcement official.”  (SOR ¶  3.d) He also  responded  negatively to  two  other questions  
that were not alleged  in  the  SOR: “In the  last seven  (7) years  have  you  been  charged,  
convicted, or sentenced  of a  crime  in any court;”  and  2) “Have  you  EVER been  convicted  
of an  offense  involving  domestic violence  or a  crime  of violence  (such  as  battery  or  
assault) against your . . . cohabitant . .  . .”  (GE 1)  
Applicant disclosed his September 2020 arrest in his 2021 SI and attributed his 
failure to list it on his SCA to oversight . He maintained the court case was dropped, no 
charges were filed, and there were no additional court requirements. In his Answer, he 
indicated he “misunderstood the question []” at the time of his SCA response . He 
explained, “There was a lot that happened last year. I was not aware of how the system 
worked . . . .” (GE 2 at 2-3; Answer) 
At the hearing, Applicant stated he did not serve jail time beyond the 24 hours he 
spent in jail following his arrest, the case was dismissed, and he was assigned a probation 
officer. During questioning about how he answered the SCA arrest question (SOR ¶ 3.d), 
he had the following exchanges: 
APPLICANT: At that time, I was probably under the medication influence, 
so some of the questions I answered maybe wrong, maybe inaccurate, but 
at that time, I [answered to the best of my knowledge]. 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So you think you were just on medication and 
that made you put down the wrong information? 
APPLICANT: Possibly, yes. 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Or were you worried that if you put down, yes, 
you wouldn't be able to get a security clearance? 
APPLICANT: Eighty percent of it, yes . . . 
ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE: You indicated to Department Counsel that you 
attributed about 80 percent of the reason why you weren't filling out the 
[2021 SCA] to concerns of what you would say might affect your clearance. 
Is that why you're not wanting to answer some of these questions today, 
because you're concerned about how that might affect your ability to get a 
security clearance? 
APPLICANT: Not much today. Not as much as when I'm filling [the 2021 
SCA] out . . . (GE 1, 2; Answer, Tr. at 87-88, 109-114, 124, 141-142)

Section  23. Applicant  responded  “no” to  “In the  last seven (7) years, have  you  
illegally used  any drugs or controlled  substances?”  (SOR ¶  3.e)  He also responded  
negatively to  three  other questions that  were  not alleged  in the  SOR: “In the  last seven  
(7) years,  have  you  been  involved  in  the  illegal purchase  .  .  . of any drug  or controlled  
substance);” “Have  you  EVER  been  ordered, advised, or asked  to  seek counseling  or 
treatment as a  result of  your illegal use  of drugs or controlled  substances;”  and  “Have  you  
EVER  voluntarily sought counseling  or treatment as a  result of your use  of a  drug  or  
controlled substance.”  (GE 1)  
Applicant did not disclose  any drug  use  during  his 2021  SI.  In  his Answer  to  SOR  
¶  3.e, he admitted, “The  last  time[]  I used  THC i[s] May 2020  and  I have  stopped. I used  
CBD that may  contain[]  little  amounts  of  THC.  I did a  drug  test in  October 2021  for a  
company  . . . and  the  results came  back as negative. ” He did not address his negative  
SCA response. At the  hearing, he  affirmed  his “no” response.  (GE 1, 2; Answer; Tr. at 87-
88, 99-101,124)  
Guideline B  
On Applicant’s 2021 SCA, he did not report any foreign contacts. During his 2021 
SI, he reported his mother maintained monthly telephonic contact with her two sisters (a 
twin and an elder), who are citizens and residents of China. He had short five to ten minute 
conversations with them whenever he was home during his mother’s calls, but denied he 
maintained close and continuing contact with them. (GE 1, 2 ; Tr. at 146 ) In Applicant’s 
Answer, he admitted: 
I have  family members  in China,  and  they  are  Uyghurs. I used  to  use  [the  
WeChat messaging  application] to  talk to  [them]  only a  few times  a  year.  
We  talk when  there are family health  concerns (My grandmother passed  
away in 2019) but other than that not very often. My family members are in  
the  railroad  industry, and  they do  not interact  with  any government related  
workers. I have  removed  [WeChat]  as of March 10, 2022. (Answer)  
At  the  hearing,  in addition  to  his mother’s two sisters,   Applicant  referenced  an  
uncle,  a  maternal cousin,  and  an  unspecified  number of paternal cousins,  who  are  also  
citizens and  residents  of  China.  He  acknowledged  he  maintained  contact  with  one  or  
more of them, without specifying  the  frequency or method  of their  communications. When 
he learned,  during his 2021  SI,  of the  potential negative impact on  his security clearance  
adjudication,  he  ceased  all  contacts with  them  and  “removed  my tools to  contact  them.”  
When  asked  how often  he  spoke  with  his cousins,  he  testified, “Barely. We  don’t talk.”  
However, he  later acknowledged  he  spoke  with  at  least  one  of them  during  the  COVID-
19 pandemic, stating:   
They got worried  when  they  heard that  I got  sick, I was  in [the]  hospital  . .  . 
It's not like  .  . . [if]  I was doing  good, they  will  never reach  out.  So  when  
something  happens,  then  .  . .  they reach  out and  are  asking  like,  what's up,  
and just very casual. (Tr. at 93-96)

Applicant’s mother testified she communicated with one of her sisters “almost every day” 
via WeChat. She stated she maintained no contact with her other sister or any other family 
members in China, and that Applicant had no contact with any family members in China, 
including her two sisters. (Tr. at 146-149) 
During the hearing, Applicant and his mother alluded to risks they associated with 
their Uyghur ethnicity, including possible surveillance of their extended family members 
in China. His mother acknowledged her contact with her sister “is dangerous for my sister” 
because China is “control[ling] . . . watch[ing] . . . checking everything,” but she intended 
to maintain contact with her sister because “I mean, she's my sister” and “I want [to keep] 
talking to her.” Applicant testified he chose not to use traditional Arabic greetings during 
previous communications with his family members in China because “those . . . words” 
would “literally put them [at] risk.” He believed there was a risk of possible detainment 
should he or his immediate family members return to China. He and his mother testified 
neither returned to China since immigrating to the United States, and they had no intent 
to return to China. He also had the following exchange: 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Did you ever tell . . . one of your doctors that 
you were involved as an agent for the U.S. or Chinese government? 
APPLICANT: No, I did not . . . but I have the capability. I know the 
languages. I mean, if you're the Chinese government that comes up to me, 
I'm going to ask you, What can you offer me. Right? But my family are on 
the line that I'm on this job, so I would probably say no. And then being the 
strong multilingual, I would want to just stay where I am and, you know, do 
what's good for me. 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay. So let's say a Chinese government 
agent came up to you and said, you have amazing language skills . . . and 
we're going to offer you $5 million. What would you say? 
APPLICANT: I'm not after money. 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What would make you change your mind? . . . 
APPLICANT: If they put my family on risk . . . 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Do you think that could happen? 
APPLICANT: I don't think so. 
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: If your family ever traveled back to China, could 
it happen? 
APPLICANT: Yeah. That will happen. But they will not. (Tr. at 17, 40 -41, 88-91, 
93-96, 146-149)

The PRC is an authoritarian state . T he paramount authority is the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP), whose members hold almost all top government and security 
positions. The PRC’s “counterterrorism efforts continued to target ethnic Uyghurs . . . as 
so-called extremists for engaging in standard practices of Islam .” Under the pretext of 
counterterrorism efforts,” the PRC actively screened, monitored, and censored its citizens 
on the internet.” (AX III at Item I; AX IV at 15, 17) 
Genocide and crimes against humanity occurred in the PRC against 
“predominantly Muslim Uyghurs . . .” The PRC committed “[s]ignificant human rights” 
abuses, including arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, and torture; 
arbitrary arrest and detention (including, more than one million ethnic Uyghurs since 
2017); arbitrary interference with privacy; and crimes involving violence targeting 
members of racial and ethnic minority groups, including Uyghurs. (AX IV at 1-2) 
The PRC “remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, 
private-sector, and critical infrastructure networks.” Moreover, the PRC’s “cyber 
espionage pursuits and its industry’s export of surveillance, information, and 
communications technologies increase the threats of aggressive cyber operations against 
the United States and the suppression of the free flow of information in cyberspac e.” 
Additionally, the PRC “leads the world in applying surveillance and censorship to monitor 
its population and repress dissent.” (AX IV at 8) 
Whole-Person Concept  
Applicant provides for his parents and sister, both monetarily and non-monetarily. 
He helped his parents pay their home mortgage, bought his mother a car, and has been 
a role model for his sister. He moved back home from State B in 2019 to attend to the 
needs of his family following the death of his maternal grandmother. He learned that the 
stress underlying his psychotic episode resulted, in part, from a difficult childhood. His 
mother and sister lauded his character. His sister described him as “the glue that holds 
[their] family together.” He cares diligently for his cat, including making its food from 
scratch. (Tr. at 18-19, 35-36, 131-133, 154, 163, 164) 
Policies  
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan , 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) . As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Egan at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” EO 10865 § 2. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
16 
 
 
 
 
           
   
         
     
        
   
 
 
        
            
         
        
  
 
    
   
        
        
          
         
        
        
       
       
         
           
 
 
     
        
 
     
 
 
 
  
 
   
     
       
    
judge’s overarching  adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An  
administrative judge  must consider all  available and  reliable information  about the  person,  
past and present,  favorable and  unfavorable.  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such de cisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” EO 10865 § 7. 
Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has 
not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burde n of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan at 531. “Substantial evidence” 
is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area 
Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the 
burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive 
¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the Government. ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2005). 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.” ISCR Case 
No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan at 531; AG ¶ 2(b). 
Analysis  
Guideline I: Psychological Conditions  
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 27: 
Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required 
for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health 
professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or 
17 
 
 
 
        
       
        
         
 
 
          
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
     
       
      
   
 
      
      
          
        
  
 
       
    
 
          
 
 
       
      
 
acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted 
when evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under 
this guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No 
negative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised 
solely on the basis of mental health counseling. 
I have considered all the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶ 28 under Guideline I. I 
find the following warrant discussion: 
(a)  behavior that casts doubt on  an  individual's judgment,  stability, reliability, 
or trustworthiness, not  covered  under any other guideline  and  that may  
indicate  an  emotional,  mental, or personality  condition, including, but  not  
limited  to, irresponsible, violent,  self-harm, suicidal, paranoid,  manipulative,  
impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  
(b)  an  opinion  by  a  duly qualified  mental  health  professional that the  
individual has a  condition  that may impair  judgment,  stability, reliability, or  
trustworthiness;  
(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization;  and  
(d)  failure to  follow a  prescribed  treatment  plan  related  to  a  diagnosed  
psychological/psychiatric condition  that may impair  judgment,  stability,  
reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited  to, failure to  take  
prescribed  medication  or failure to attend required counseling sessions.  
Although the facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.m, 1.n, 1.p, 1.s, and 1.w are largely 
established by Applicant’s admissions and the record evidence, they are either duplicative 
of other SOR allegations or do not involve disqualifying conduct under Guideline I. 
Accordingly, I find these six allegations in Applicant’s favor under Guideline I . 
Nevertheless, they remain relevant to mitigation and the whole-person concept. 
The facts alleged in the remaining 20 allegations involve conduct that is both 
disqualifying and not disqualifying under Guideline I. I find in favor of Applicant with 
respect to those portions of the allegations involving conduct that is not disqualifying 
under Guideline I. As to the remaining portions of the allegations involving conduct that 
is disqualifying, I find that: 
AG ¶ 28(a) is established by the facts involving the disqualifying behaviors alleged 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, 1.g through 1.l, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t, and 1.u; 
AG ¶ 28(b) is established by the facts surrounding the diagnoses alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.d, 1.h, and 1.j, and 1.z; 
AG ¶ 28(c) is established by the facts involving the inpatient hospitalizations 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.o; and 
18 
 
 
 
            
       
 
 
           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
         
  
        
          
      
   
     
      
 
 
        
         
AG ¶ 28(d) is established by the facts involving the Applicant’s failure to follow 
prescribed treatment plan , including taking prescribed medications, alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.v, 1.x through 1.z. 
The following factors set forth in AG ¶ 29 could mitigate the concern under this 
guideline: 
(a) the  identified  condition  is readily controllable with  treatment, and  the  
individual  has  demonstrated  ongoing  and  consistent  compliance  with  the  
treatment plan;  
(b) the  individual  has  voluntarily entered  a  counseling  or  treatment  program  
for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently  
receiving  counseling  or treatment with  a  favorable prognosis by  a  duly  
qualified mental health professional;  
(c)  recent opinion  by a  duly qualified  mental health  professional employed  
by, or acceptable  to  and  approved  by, the  U.S.  Government that  an  
individual's previous  condition  is under control or in  remission,  and  has  a  
low probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  
(d) the  past  psychological/psychiatric condition  was temporary, the  situation   
has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of   
emotional instability; and  
(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  
AG ¶  29(a)  is not established. The  record  suggests, but does not unequivocally  
establish, Applicant’s Schizophreniform  and  Bipolar I Disorders may be  controllable with  
medication. The  record  indicates his Cannabis  Use Disorder is controllable by abstinence.  
However, Applicant  failed  to  meet his burden  to  demonstrate  ongoing  and  consistent  
compliance with taking his prescribed  medication or abstaining from  marijuana.  
AG ¶ 29 (b) is not established . Applicant is credited with engaging in outpatient 
treatment at Program X through March 2021 to address his Schizophreniform, Bipolar I, 
and Cannabis Use Disorders. Without sufficient corroborating evidence, I am not able to 
conclude he continued treatment at Program X through April 2022, as he claimed. Even 
assuming arguendo that he did, there is no indication he received any counseling or 
treatment since April 2022, nor received a favorable prognosis by TP or another duly 
qualified mental health professional. Moreover, the record suggests Applicant’s renewed 
interest in treatment in March 2021, following his prolonged indifference and denial, was 
motivated more by his pending court date than a shift in his prior belief that treatment was 
unnecessary. 
AG ¶ 29 (c) is not established. The record does not include an opinion in 
accordance with AG ¶ 29(c). In September 2020, Applicant was clinically stable, with no 
19 
 
 
 
       
    
 
      
        
  
       
        
         
    
      
         
          
         
          
 
 
      
       
        
        
          
         
  
  
      
   
      
      
     
    
 
 
      
        
         
        
        
          
         
       
  
 
  
signs of mania or psychosis ; but, in February 2021, TP assessed he was at substantial 
risk of relapse, while noting it was impossible to predict the course of his illness. 
AG ¶¶ 29(d) and (e) are not established. The record indicates Applicant’s psychotic 
episode began in about May 2020, and resolved sometime between August and October 
2020. However, he was diagnosed with Schizophreniform and Bipolar I Disorders, which 
carry a risk of relapse or recurrence. Despite the differential diagnoses, nothing in record 
established they were temporary conditions. The fact that TP diagnosed Applicant with 
Bipolar I Disorder after his psychotic episode ended indicates he continued to exhibit 
symptoms not yet resolved. Arguably, despite the lack of a prognosis in the record, the 
Cannabis Use Disorder diagnosis could be considered temporary and resolved with 
abstinence. However, Applicant did not meet his burden to establish it as such . 
Particularly given the credibility concerns, which are discussed further below, and the lack 
of a recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional proffering a positive 
prognosis, I am unable to conclude there is no indication of a current psychological 
disorder. 
TP considered differential diagnoses to explain Applicant’s behavior in connection 
with his 2020 psychotic episode. Regardless of the final diagnosis, TP emphasiz ed the 
need for Applicant to continue medication for maintenance and prophylaxis , and 
recommended he consider outpatient treatment to better manage his illness. I considered 
the improvements in his symptoms noted by TP through March 2021, and the apparent 
lack of relapse or recurrence through the hearing date. However, Applicant failed to meet 
his burden to mitigate the Guideline I concerns. 
TP assessed Applicant was medically capable of making medication decisions in 
December 2020; and that outpatient treatment was no longer medically necessary in 
February 2021. Accordingly, Applicant’s decisions to discontinue taking medication after 
January 2021, and discontinue treatment after March 2021 (or, assuming arguendo, after 
April 2022) could be considered reasonable within the context of his medical care. 
However, in the context of evaluating his security worthiness, those decisions undermine 
mitigation. 
Applicant’s engagement in treatment at Program X was sporadic at best. In March 
2021, he was better able to acknowledge the severity of his psychotic episode, but he 
remained unable to grasp the potential for recurrence. At the hearing, he disputed the 
diagnoses, while also claiming he was fully recovered and could manage his conditions 
without medication. However, he did not proffer a recent opinion by a duly qualified mental 
health professional to corroborate his position . The concer n is exacerbated by his 
continued denial and lack of insight about his conditions during the hearing and his lack 
of candor regarding his marijuana use . I have substantial doubts about his current 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Guideline H: Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse  
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 24: 
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of 
prescription and non -prescription drugs, and the use of other substances 
that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner 
inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may 
lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises 
questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, 
and regulations. Controlled substance means any "controlled substance" as 
defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in 
this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. 
According to 2017 guidance from the SAMHSA, 
The marijuana analyte tested in urine is tetrahydrocannabinol -carboxylic 
acid (THCA). THCA is a metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the 
primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana. CBD is a different chemical 
compound present in the marijuana plant . Marijuana products, including 
CBD, are classified as Schedule I controlled substances under the 
Controlled Substances Act and, thus, are illegal under federal law; and 
Many CBD oils and other marijuana -derived products are sold over the 
internet or at dispensaries in states allowing marijuana use, either 
recreationally or medically. These products are not regulated by the Food 
and Drug Administration for content and may be contaminated by a host of 
cannabinoid chemicals, including THC and CBD. CBD is chemically 
distinguishable from THC and will not cause a positive drug test result under 
the current drug testing panel but is a Schedule I drug. However, CBD 
products may co ntain other cannabinoids such as THC, therefore, use of 
CBD oils and marijuana-derived products may result in a positive urine drug 
test for THCA. 
According to 2021 guidance from the DNI, 
With  respect to  the  use  of CBD  products,  agencies should be  aware  that  
using  these  cannabis  derivatives  may be  relevant  to  adjudications in  
accordance  with  SEAD 4.  Although  the  passage  of the  Agricultural 
Improvement  Act of 2018  excluded  hemp  from  the  definition  of  marijuana  
within the  Controlled  Substances  Act,  products containing  greater than  a  
0.3  percent concentration  of delta-9 [THC], a  psychoactive  ingredient in 
marijuana, do  not meet the  definition  of "hemp."  Accordingly, products  
labeled  as  hemp-derived  that  contain  greater than  0.3  percent THC  
continue  to  meet the  legal definition  of marijuana, and  therefore remain  
illegal to  use  under  federal law and  policy.  Additionally, agencies  should be  
21 
 
 
 
     
       
        
         
 
     
      
 
 
          
      
  
      
      
      
         
        
      
       
         
   
  
 
 
 
       
    
 
 
 
 
 
aware that the Federal Drug Administration does not certify levels of THC 
in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot be guaranteed, thus 
posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal law. 
Studies have shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC 
threshold for hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels . . . Therefore, there 
is a risk that using these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high 
levels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under agency -
administered employment or random drug testing programs. 
2014 DNI guidance affirms marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled drug under 
federal law; federal marijuana laws supersede state laws; and changes in the laws 
pertaining to marijuana by states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the 
existing AG. 2021 DNI guidance reaffirmed that federal law remains unchanged with 
respect to marijuana use, possession, production and distribution; and that individuals 
who hold security clearances or occupy a sensitive position within the federal government 
are currently prohibited by law from using controlled substances, such as marijuana, on 
or off-duty. 2021 DNI guidance also made clear that prior recreational marijuana use by 
an individual applying for a security clearance or national security positio n might be 
relevant to adjudications, but not determinative. The guidance instructed federal agencies 
to adjudicate each potential applicant through a "whole -person concept" by evaluating 
multiple variables in an individual's life to determine whether past marijuana use raises a 
security concern and whether that concern has been mitigated. 
I construed  the  references to  Applicant’s use  of marijuana,  cannabis, and  THC (as  
opposed  to  CBD)  throughout the  record  evidence  as synonymous for his use  of the  same  
controlled  substance.  For simplicity,  the  term  “marijuana”  will  be  used  hereafter.  His CBD  
use, including  oils and  edibles, was not alleged  in the  SOR. Moreover, the  record did not  
contain  sufficient facts  to  ascertain whether he  used  CBD containing  amounts of THC  
sufficient  to  render  it a  controlled  substance.  Accordingly,  I  have  considered  his CBD use, 
not as disqualifying conduct, but as to  mitigation and the whole-person concept.  
The record evidence and Applicant’s admissions surrounding his marijuana use 
establish the following disqualifying conditions set forth in AG ¶ 25 under this guideline: 
(a) any substance  misuse (see above  definition);  
(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  
(c)  illegal possession  of a  controlled  substance, including  cultivation,  
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,  or distribution; or possession  of  
drug paraphernalia;  and   
(d) diagnosis by a  duly qualified  medical or mental health  professional  (e.g.,  
physician,  clinical psychologist, psychiatrist,  or licensed  clinical  social

Given the facts alleged in SOR ¶ 2.d, AG ¶ 25(g) (expressed intent to continue 
drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to 
discontinue such misuse) warrants discussion. The facts alleged in SOR ¶ 2.d are not 
established by either Applicant’s admissions or the record evidence , and the SOR does 
not otherwise allege facts to support the application of AG ¶ 25(g). Accordingly, I find 
SOR ¶ 2.d in Applicant’s favor. Nevertheless, Applicant’s equivocation and denials about 
his use of marijuana remain relevant to mitigation and the whole-person concept. 
Having considered all the factors set forth in AG ¶ 26 that could mitigate the 
concern under this guideline, I find the following warrant discussion: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or happened  
under such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur or does  not cast  doubt  
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   
(b) the  individual acknowledges his or her drug  involvement and  substance  
misuse,  provides evidence  of actions taken  to  overcome  this problem, and  
has established  a  pattern of  abstinence, including, but not limited  to: (1)  
disassociation  from  drug-using  associates and  contacts; (2) changing  or  
avoiding  the  environment where  drugs  were used;  and  (3) providing  a  
signed  statement of intent to  abstain from  all  drug  involvement and  
substance  misuse, acknowledging  that any future involvement or misuse  is 
grounds for revocation  of national security eligibility; and  
(d) satisfactory completion  of a  prescribed  drug  treatment program,  
including,  but  not limited  to,  rehabilitation  and  aftercare  requirements,  
without recurrence  of  abuse, and  a  favorable  prognosis by a  duly qualified  
medical professional.  
The precise timeline and frequency of Applicant’s marijuana use was difficult to 
ascertain given Applicant’s underreporting and equivocation. Nevertheless, the record 
established by substantial evidence that he used marijuana regularly for an extended 
period, including after being diagnosed with cannabis use disorder. At the hearing, he not 
only failed to take responsibility for his marijuana use, but he inexplicably denied he ever 
used marijuana, despite his prior admission s, which undermined his credibili ty and the 
sincerity of his commitment to abstain. 
Applicant disputed his Cannabis Use Disorder diagnosis , which he attributed 
initially to his deliberate consumption of marijuana in edible form; and then to his use of 
CBD, which he considered legal. He claimed his August 2020 positive test resulted from 
what he believed was a legal use of CBD that may have contained THC. He indicated he 
understood marijuana use was illegal under federal law. He acknowledged he frequently 
used and purchased CBD, but denied he ever intentionally used or purchased CBD 
containing amounts of THC sufficient to render it a controlled substance. However, he 
failed to meet his burden to establish innocent consumption as to his diagnosis or positive 
test.

Applicant’s continued lack of candor regarding his marijuana use raises questions 
about the complete and accurate details of his history with it, and also suggests a pattern 
of questionable judgment that undermines confidence in his ability or willingness to 
comply with laws, rules, and regulations. I considered TP’s favorable status notations 
about his Cannabis Use Disorder between September 2020 and February 2021 . 
However, neither TP’s notes nor other record evidence establish that Applicant was 
provided a favorable prognosi s. Moreover, Applicant failed to meet his bur den to 
demonstrate a sustained period of abstinence. In light of the record as a whole, I am 
unable to conclude his illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. I have doubts about his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG ¶ ¶ 26(a), 26(b), and 26(d) are not 
established. 
Guideline E:  Personal Conduct  
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. O f special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in 
an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance 
action, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: 
(a) refusal, or failure  without reasonable cause, to  undergo  or  
cooperate  with  security processing, including  but not limited  
to  meeting  with  a  security investigator for  subject  interview,  
completing  security forms or releases, cooperation  with  
medical or psychological evaluation,  or polygraph  
examination, if authorized and required; and  
(b) refusal to  provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful  
questions of investigators, security officials, or other official  
representatives in  connection  with  a  personnel security or 
trustworthiness determination.  
Applicant’s falsification  of material facts on  his 2021  SCA establishes the  general  
concerns  involving  questionable  judgment  and  unwillingness to  comply  with  rules and  
regulations, and  renders the  following  specific disqualifying  condition  potentially  
applicable:  
AG ¶ 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.

Applicant answered “I admit” in response to each of the Guideline E falsification 
allegations. However, he otherwise denied that the admitted falsifications were deliberate. 
Accordingly, I construed his responses as denials and find the falsification allegations 
controverted. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the 
burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An 
administrative judge must consider the record evide nce as a whole to determine an 
applicant’s state of mind at the time of the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant’s education and experience are relevant to determining 
whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was 
deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). 
The falsifications alleged in the SOR involve Applicant’s hospitalizations (SOR ¶¶ 
3.a-3.c), September 2020 arrest (SOR ¶ 3.d), and marijuana use (SOR ¶ 3.e). Among 
these three categories, Applicant provided negative responses to all but one question 
about his hospitalization history. He disclosed he was voluntarily hospitalized from June 
to August 2020, and he identified the address and location of the service provider for 
Program X (which is not a hospital) . I did not find credible Applicant’s explanations and 
excuses for his failure to disclose derogatory information about his marijuana use, arrest, 
and hospitalization history. Not only did he provide inaccurate information about his 
reported hospitalization on the SCA, but he also omitted materially relevant information. 
Inexplicably, at the hearing, he contradicted his earlier admissions about marijuana use, 
which damaged his overall credibility. He also testified that, at the time he completed his 
SCA, he considered the possibility that disclosing his arrest would impede his ability to 
get a security clearance. I find substantial evidence of an intent on the part of Applicant 
to omit and conceal materially relevant information from his 2021 SCA. AG ¶ 16(a) is 
established. 
Nevertheless, I  find  in  favor of Applicant with  respect to  the  following  portions  of  
the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  3.c through  3.e,  which involve  conduct  that is not  disqualifying  
under Guideline  E: (1)  the  subparagraphs cross-alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.c that  contain  facts  
involving his two  emergency room visits (1.b, 1.g) and treatment at the crisis center (1.j),  
which  were  not inpatient hospitalizations; (2) the  subparagraphs cross-alleged  in  SOR ¶  
3.d  that do  not  contain  facts  involving  his  arrest (1.b, 1.c,  1.g, 1.k, and  1.o); and  (3) the  
subparagraphs cross-alleged  in SOR ¶  3.d  that do  not contain facts about his illegal drug  
use  that are responsive  to  the  SCA  question  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.d  (1.d,  1.e,  1.j,  1.l,  1.m,  
1.w, 2.b-2.d).   
The security concerns raised under this guideline have not been mitigated by either 
of the following applicable factors: 
AG ¶  17(a): the  individual made  prompt,  good-faith  efforts  to  correct the  
omission, concealment,  or falsification  before  being  confronted  with  the  
facts;  and   
AG ¶  17(c): the  offense  is so  minor, or so  much  time  has passed, or the  
behavior is so infrequent,  or it happened under such unique circumstances  
25 
 
 
 
      
 
 
       
         
        
         
           
      
       
       
 
 
     
       
         
         
     
      
       
      
          
   
 
  
        
        
     
         
    
  
 
     
         
            
            
         
         
        
         
          
  
 
  
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
The security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or 
narrowly parse the truth. The Federal Government has a compelling interest in protecting 
and safeguarding classified information . That compelling interest includes the 
government's legitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions (based on 
complete and accurate information) about who will be granted access to classified 
information. An applicant who deliberately fails to giv e full, frank, and candid answers to 
the government in connection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication 
interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01 -03132 
at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). 
AG ¶ 17(a) is not established. Applicant’s partial disclosure on his 2021 SCA about 
his hospitalization history was not only misleading, but also had the potential to impact 
the way the information was evaluated during the adjudication process. He is credited 
with providing additional information about his mental health condition during his 2021 SI. 
However, the information involved solely his voluntary outpatient treatment at Program X, 
and not any disclosures about his four inpatient hospitalizations. He is further credited 
with disclosing, during his 2021 SI, that he was arrested in September 2020 . However, 
he failed to disclose he was placed on probation, which was materially relevant. There is 
no indication in the record that he reported any information about his marijuana use during 
his 2021 SI. 
AG ¶ 17(c) is not established. I considered that Applicant was still in treatment for 
psychiatric conditions and may have been under the influence of a prescribed 
antipsychotic when he certified his SCA in January 2021 ; and that the assault and 
hospitalizations occurred in or around the period of his psychosis and manic episodes . 
However, these factors do not suffice to overcome the Guideline E concerns, particularly 
given that his medical capacity to answer questions accurately and truthfully was not 
addressed in the record by a duly qualified mental health professional. 
More compelling are the following factors that weigh against mitigation. Applicant 
failed to avail himself of opportunities to provide derogatory information on his SCA in 
response to other pertinent questions besides those alleged in the SOR. He failed to take 
accountability for his deliberate omissions in his Answer and at the hearing. He was aware 
of the potentially negative impact derogatory information could have on his security 
clearance at the time he completed his SCA. He emphatically denied ever using 
marijuana at the hearing, despite his earlier admission s and the substantial evidence to 
the contrary, separate and apart from any use of CBD that may have been considered 
legal. Given Appellant’s lack of candor at the hearing and the record as a whole, I have 
doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.

Guideline B: Foreign Influence  
The security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG ¶ 6, 
as follows: 
Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, 
financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result 
in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they 
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced 
to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way 
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure 
or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts an d 
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest 
is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is 
known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or 
is associated with a risk of terrorism. 
The following are potentially relevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline: 
AG ¶  7(a): contact,  regardless of method, with  a  foreign  family member,  
business or professional associate, friend, or other person  who  is a  citizen  
of or resident in a  foreign  country if that contact creates a  heightened  risk 
of foreign  exploitation, inducement,  manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  
AG ¶  7(b): connections to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or country  
that create  a  potential conflict of interest  between  the  individual's obligation  
to  protect classified  or sensitive information  or technology and  the  
individual's desire  to  help a  foreign  person, group, or country by providing  
that information or technology; and   
AG ¶  7(e): shared  living  quarters with  a  person  or persons, regardless of  
citizenship status, if that relationship  creates  a  heightened  risk of foreign  
inducement,  manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  
Applicant’s familial ties to citizens and residents of China establish AG ¶¶ 7(a), 
7(b), and 7(e). A heightened risk is associated with the Chinese government, an 
authoritarian government dominated by the Communist Party, due to its espionage 
pursuits against the United States, poor human rights record, and targeting of ethnic 
Uyghurs. Applicant bears the burden of persuasion to mitigate these concerns. ISCR 
Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000). Because China is hostile to the United 
States, his b urden is “very heavy” to show that neither he nor his family members are 
subject to influence by China. ISCR Case No. 06-17838 (App. Bd. Jan 28, 2008). 
Application  of the  guidelines is not a  comment on  an  applicant’s patriotism  but  
merely an  acknowledgment that people may  act in unpredictable ways when  faced  with  
choices that could be  important to  a  loved  one, such  as a  family member. ISCR  Case  No.  
27 
 
 
 
      
       
        
      
            
          
          
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
      
      
        
       
     
  
 
08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) . Family relationships can involve matters of 
influence or obligation. ISCR Case No. 02 -04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003) . The mere 
possession of close family ties with one or more family members living in a foreign country 
is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant has a 
close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign c ountry, this factor alone is 
sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could pot entially result in the 
compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 
15, 2006; ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). 
The following are potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline: 
AG ¶  8(a): the  nature of the  relationships with  foreign  persons, the  country  
in which  these  persons are  located,  or  the  positions  or activities of  those  
persons in  that country are such  that it is unlikely the  individual will  be  placed  
in a  position  of having  to  choose  between  the  interests of a  foreign  
individual, group, organization, or government and  the  interests  of the  
United States;  
AG ¶  8(b): there is no  conflict of interest, either because  the  individual's  
sense  of loyalty or obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or allegiance  to  the  
group, government,  or country is so  minimal, or the  individual has such  deep  
and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,  that the  
individual can  be  expected  to  resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the  
U.S. interest;  and   
AG ¶  8(c): contact or communication  with  foreign  citizens is so  casual and  
infrequent that there is  little likelihood  that it could create  a  risk for foreign  
influence or exploitation.  
Applicant ceased communications with his extended family residing in China in 
about March 2021 due to concerns with how those communications could impact his 
security clearance adjudication. However, his familial relationships with them cannot be 
considered casual. His mother remains in frequent contact with at least one of her sisters. 
While it has not been established that any of his extended family in China maintain 
security-significant affiliations with the Chinese government, there remains a heightened 
risk associated with China regardless of any such affiliations. 
Based  upon  the  existing  record, I  am  unable  to  ascertain  the extent of Applicant’s  
assets in the  United  States. However, Applicant otherwise established  strong  ties  to  the  
United  States.  Since  immigrating  over fourteen  years  ago, he  has studied,  lived,  and  
worked  exclusively in the  United  States. Moreover, all  his immediate  family reside  in  the  
United  States. Neither  he  nor his immediate  family have  plans  to  return to  China  given  
the  perceived  risks associated  with  their  Uyghur ethnicity.  Nevertheless, Applicant  failed  
to  meet his burden  to  establish  that his strong  ties to  United  States are sufficient  to  
overcome  his strong  ties to  extended  family residing  in  China, who  are vulnerable to  a  
foreign  government known for its poor human  rights record, espionage  pursuits against  
the United  States, and  targeting of ethnic Uyghurs.  
28 
 
 
 
      
        
              
         
    
 
 
     
       
        
          
       
   
 
 
       
            
           
        
     
      
         
  
 
 
      
  
 
   
 
    
 
    
 
   
 
   
Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude it is unlikely Applicant will be placed 
in a position of having to choose between the interests of one or more members of his 
extended family residing in China and that of the United States. Applicant failed to meet 
his heavy burden to mitigate the Guideline B concern. There remains a potential risk for 
foreign influence or exploitation. AG ¶¶ 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are not established. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the AG, 
each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. In evaluating the 
relevance of an individual’s conduct, an administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  
and  other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  for the  conduct;  
(8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  (9) the  
likelihood  of continuation or recurrence.  
I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I, H, E and B in my whole -
person analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After considering the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines I, H, E, and B, and evaluating all 
the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not 
mitigated security concerns involving psychological conditions, drug involvement and 
substance misuse, personal conduct, and foreign influence . Accordingly, Applicant has 
not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
