Decision  
LAFAYE, Gatha, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised 
under Guideline F (financial considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 15, 
2021. On November 18, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under 
Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 23, 2022, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. On February 12, 2024 , the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that his hearing was scheduled to be conducted 
by video teleconference on March 19, 2024. The hearing was convened as scheduled.

On March 6, 2024, prior to the hearing, Department Counsel amended the SOR to 
add SOR ¶ 1.k. Applicant did not respond to the SOR amendment prior to the hearing, 
but acknowledged receipt of the new allegation and expressed his desire to proceed with 
the hearing as scheduled. (Tr. 7, 103-110) 
At the March 19, 2024 hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1 through GE 9, which were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant 
offered documentary evidence, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and AE B 
and admitted in evidence with out objection. Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant 
disclosed new federal income tax issues, which raised additional financial considerations 
security concerns and required a second amendment to the SOR. I continued the hearing 
until a later date to allow the parties time to prepare to address the new allegations. 
On March 20, 2024, Department Counsel offered to amend the SOR a second time 
to conform to the evidence, adding SOR ¶¶ 1.l through 1.n, which I accepted. Applicant 
answered the second amendment to the SOR on May 17, 2024, and edited his answer 
prior to the start of the hearing scheduled for June 6, 2024. I reconvened the hearing as 
scheduled. Applicant offered additional documentary evidence at the hearing, which I 
labeled as AE C through AE G, and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA 
received the first hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 29, 2024 , and the second hearing 
transcript (Tr2.) on June 20, 2024. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 
1.h., and 1.j , and denied allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i. He answered 
security concerns alleged in the amended SOR during both hearings, and admitted SOR 
¶¶ 1.k through 1.n. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After 
careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
Applicant is 62 years old. He earned his high school diploma in 1980. Shortly after 
graduation, he enlisted in the Navy, and served as an electronics technician from July 
1980 until his honorable discharge in August 1985. He attended college for about two 
years, but did not complete his degree. Applicant was first married from 1989 to 2002. He 
married a second time in 2004, and has two children, ages 32 and 17. His youngest child 
resides with him and his wife. (GE 1; Tr. 25-26 ) 
Applicant is an established businessman and entrepreneur who successfully 
developed and sold technical companies doing classified work. In 2003, he and his wife 
started a high-tech company, developed it for about five years, and sold it to a private 
equity firm in 2009, earning about $3 million in profit. In late 2009, he started another 
technical company, developed it for about four years, and sold it to a defense contractor 
in 2014. He said he stayed o n and worked for the defense contractor as vice president 
and consultant from 2014 through September 2019. He earned about $200,000 per year 
working for the defense contractor. After deductions, his net income totaled about $8,000 
monthly. (GE 1; Tr. 13-14,41-42)

In 2014, Applicant and his wife started three small businesses styling and cutting 
hair (hair salons), in which neither he nor his wife had experience. The three businesses 
(S1, S2, and S3) were independent, separately managed, distinct entities established in 
three different states. (Tr. 13-15, AE A ) The first business (S1) was established as an 
equity-based business where licensed hair stylists would rent booths and pay a monthly 
fee for the rental. It was not making a profit, but it was steady and operated at margin . 
(Tr. 53-54) The second business (S2), developed as an employee-based business with 
eight employees, was the most successful , making profits of up to $800,000 per year. 
The third business (S3), was the largest. It had about 26 employees and provided haircare 
services to both men and women, but was never profitable. (Tr. 53-54) 
Applicant and  his wife  used  proceeds from  the  sale of prior businesses, their  
personal savings,  and  personal and  business credit cards to  finance  and  operate  the  
three  hair  salons.  In  2019,  they  decided  to  wind  down  the  businesses, closing  all  three  
due to  significant  business and  personal financial losses. Applicant  said that he  and  his  
wife  filed  bankruptcy  under Chapter 11  for S2  and  S3  (Tr. 63, 68- 69)  He also filed  for  
personal bankruptcy  under Chapter 13  in 2019, discussed  in  SOR ¶  1.a  below; and  his  
wife  filed  for personal bankruptcy  under Chapter 13  one  year before  his action. (Tr.  63-
70)  Chapter 11  bankruptcy records for the  businesses were  not  offered  in evidence. 
Applicant said  he  used  profits from  S2  to  help keep  S1  and  S3  afloat, and  that  his  wife  
primarily operated the  businesses but did not take  a salary.  (Tr. 52-55)  
From October 2019 through January 2021, Applicant worked as a vice president 
for a private company, earning about $175,000 per year, with a net pay of about $7,000 
per month . In February 2021, he accepted a new position working as a business 
development consultant for a defense contractor , his current employer and security 
clearance sponsor. (Tr. 47-48) His annual gross pay in 2023 was $255,599, with a net 
pay of about $10,000 per month. The company also incentivizes his pay, adding potential 
bonus amounts up to 20 percent of his base pay, about $10,000 to $46,000 annually. His 
wife’s annual gross pay in 2023 was $159,186, with a net pay of about $7,000 per month. 
(AE A 4-5; Tr. 38-42, 48-50) 
Applicant and his wife still own their home valued at about $1 .3 million . They 
previously owned a vacation property, a condominium located in another state, which 
they purchased with cash in 2010. Applicant also previously owned a half -interest in a 
rental property he purchased with a joint investor in 2006. The property was consistently 
“underwater,” the joint investor “walked away” from the investment, Applicant was unable 
to sell it, and the bank would not approve it for short sale or foreclosure. For about 10 
years, he rented the property for nearly a 50% discount before he was able to dispose of 
it through a short sale transfer in December 2023. (Tr. 27, 30-32, 42-46; AE A 8-11) 
Applicant completed his SCA in September 2021. In Section 26, Financial Record, 
he disclosed he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2019. He also disclosed he owed 
$54,043 to the federal government for failure to pay employee withholding taxes, for his 
“wife’s” businesses. (GE 1) He claimed to be “current, not delinquent” on payments, and 
that he pays “$1,500 monthly” directly to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (GE 9)

Applicant also disclosed delinquent debts involving routine accounts, and 
discussed them in his October and November 2021 background interviews. He did not 
disclose any other income tax issues. He said his overall financial situation was sound, 
and that he was current on all bills. (GE 1, 9) During the hearing, he attributed his overall 
financial situation to the failure of his businesses, and poor economic conditions due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. 14-16, 58; Tr2. 39) 
The SOR, as amended, alleged 14 financial allegations, including a bankruptcy 
action, delinquent debts totaling over $1.1 million, failure to file income tax returns, and 
delinquent taxes for unpaid employee tax withholdings. (SOR Answer; GE 1-9) 
The evidence regarding the SOR allegations is summarized below: 
SOR ¶ 1.a (Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed Feb. 2019): Applicant filed a Chapter 
13 bankruptcy petition in February 2019. In the petition, he claimed he had up to 49 
creditors, assets totaling up to $50,000, and liabilities totaling between $1 million and $10 
million. His income at the time exceeded $17,700 monthly. (GE 6) The bankruptcy trustee 
moved to dismiss the case with prejudice because Applicant did not disclose his 
condominium. His wife had previously disclosed their condominium in her bankruptcy 
petition, which resulted in her case being dismissed on jurisdictional grounds for 
exceeding the secured debt limit . Applicant did not disclose the condo minium because 
he believed he no longer had an ownership interest due to the creditor’s confiscation of 
the asset. Applicant’s case was later dismissed, without prejudice, for exceeding the 
secured debt limit. (GE 1; Tr. 64-69) 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($33,403 charged off): Applicant admitted this credit card debt on an 
account opened in August 2012. The creditor closed the account in November 2017, and 
the last payment was made in January 2018. Applicant said he used this personal credit 
card for business-related expenses. He has remained in communication with the creditor, 
who offered to settle the account for a $10,000 lump -sum payment. He is still in 
communication with them, but has not paid on the account since January 2018. (GE 2-4; 
Tr. 69-72; AE A 3,8-11, AE D) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($16,449 charged off), and 1.e ($11,124 charged off): In his answer, 
Applicant denied both debts from the same creditor , stating the accounts are current 
based on payment arrangements made with the creditor. SOR ¶ 1.c, opened in August 
1992, was charged off in late 2021. SOR ¶ 1.e, opened in December 2016, was also 
charged off in late 2021 . Applicant has paid $50 per month on e ach account since he 
established payment arrangements with the creditor in August 2020 . He provided proof 
he is current on payments for both accounts. (GE 2-4; Tr. 72-78, 81-83; AE A at 3, AE C) 
SOR ¶ 1.d ($15,094 charged off): In his answer, Applicant denied this individual 
account opened in April 2015 , stating the total debt charged off was “incorrect.” The 
account was charged off for $15,094, and the last payment was made in January 2019. 
Applicant said this was opened as a business account not an individual account, that he 
stopped paying when the business failed, and that he had no intention of paying the debt.

He said he recently challenged the debt, and that the creditor removed it from his credit 
report. However, no documentary evidence was provided to support these assertions and 
the debt appears in a March 2024 credit bureau report (CBR). (GE 2-4; Tr. 79-81) 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($6,678 charged off ): Applicant admitted this debt on an individual 
credit card account opened in October 2016. The first major delinquency occurred August 
2019, and it was charged off in February 2020. Applicant said he used this personal 
account for business expenses. He has not made payment arrangements or payments, 
but intends to pay the debt in the future. (GE 2-4; Tr. 83-85) 
SOR ¶ 1. g ($719 collection account): Applicant denied this debt, an individual 
consumer account opened in May 2021. He said he returned the cable equipment for the 
condominium, but the company said he did not. He disputed this through a credit bureau, 
and the account was removed from his CBR. Though a dispute of the debt is not indicated 
in the 2021 or 2022 CBRs, this debt does not appear in 2024 CBR. (GE 2-4; Tr. 85-89) 
SOR ¶ 1.h ($28,335 past due of $58,879 total debt): Applicant admitted this debt, 
an individual home equity line of credit on his rental property opened in September 2006. 
The March 2024 CBR reported that Applicant last paid the debt in January 2018, and the 
debt was charged off for $62,828 in November 2023. (GE 2 at 7) The rental property was 
foreclosed and sold in a short sale finalized in December 2023. It reflected a deficient 
balance. (AE A 8-11) 
Applicant said this debt was “disposed of in short sale/foreclosure,” and that he did 
not owe “any remaining amounts on this loan.” He said he never received a request for 
payment from this creditor, and the account was no longer accessible after the short sale 
in December 2023 . (GE 2-4; Tr. 89-92; AE A at 3) As evidence he no longer owed the 
debt, he submitted form 1099-A, which was completed by the creditor and reported to the 
IRS. On the form, the creditor checked box 5, which reads: “If checked, the borrower was 
personally liable for repayment of the debt.” (AE D) 
SOR ¶ 1.i ($ 186,455 charged off ): Applicant admitted this debt, a n individual 
account opened in September 2015, and charged off for $186,455 in 2019. He said it is 
a home equity loan on his primary residence . In August 2020, he made payment 
arrangements with the creditor, paying $500 per month. He submitted proof of the ir 
arrangements and his compliance with the agreed terms. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 92-99; AE C) 
SOR ¶ 1.j ($45,986 past due of $250,200 total debt ): Applicant admitted this 
individual mortgage debt on his rental property opened in October 2013. In October 2021, 
the debt was reported 120 days past due , for $45,986. The last payment occurred in 
March 2021. (GE 4 at 6) Applicant submitted evidence the rental property was foreclosed 
in November 2023, and reflected a deficiency balance of $23,262. He said he did not 
receive a request to pay the deficit balance, and the balance on the account is reflected 
as zero in the 2024 CBR and AE G. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. 99-102; AE G)

SOR ¶ 1.k ($553,726 charged off): Applicant admitted this debt, a joint loan he 
and his wife received in November 2015, backed by the Small Business Administration 
(SBA), for the benefit of their 2014 startup businesses, S1, S2, and S3 . All three 
businesses were shuttered in 2019. S2 and S3 were closed via Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
(Tr. 68-69) 
Applicant’s last payment on this SBA-backed loan occurred in November 2019. 
(GE 2 at 7) The SBA creditor sold assets and collaterals of the businesses to mitigate the 
financial loss and presented the remaining balance to Applicant for payment. Applicant 
said he was unable to pay the $500,000 remaining balance, or the monthly installment 
amount offered by the creditor, and that no further negotiations were allowed. He said he 
disputed the final amount charged for the loan because he did not believe he was fully 
credited for collaterals sold against the loan, but did not present proof to substantiate the 
basis of any dispute. Applicant did not make any payments on the loan from December 
2019 through November 2022. (GE 2; Tr. 103-111; AE B; Tr2. at 28) 
The creditor charged off the debt, activated the SBA guarantee, and turned over 
the defaulted loan to SBA for collection. SBA exercised its right to collect Applicant’s 
nontax debt in default by wage garnishment through the U.S. Treasury. The garnishment 
set his payments at 15% of net pay , and started in December 2022. The amount 
garnished per month was “blacked-out” on Applicant’s wage garnishment worksheet. (AE 
B at 4) The total amount garnished for the first 12 months was $28,110. (AE B at 7) The 
amount garnished from January to March 2024 was $8,214. He said his wages are 
subject to garnishment for 10 years from the “demand” of payment, not 10 years after 
garnishment starts, from about 2021 . (Tr. at 111) Any balance remaining after that time 
is uncollectable. (GE 2; Tr. 103-111; AE B; Tr2. 28) It is unclear whether the SBA will be 
able to collect the loan should Applicant leave his wage-earning (W2) position. Moreover, 
considering the amounts being collected, the total amount collected would be less than 
65% of the obligation. 
SOR ¶ 1 .l (failed to pa y the IRS $54,000 for employee tax withholdings ): 
Applicant disclosed these unpaid taxes in his SCA, and admitted at the hearing that he 
and his wife owed this debt. (GE 1; Tr2. at 15) He said the IRS informed them that they 
failed to report and pay employee withholding taxes for the S2 business. (Tr. 119) He said 
his wife was the chief executive officer of S2, and he was a managing member helping to 
manage payroll, and other operati ons. (Tr. 122) Applicant did not offer or submit S2 
business records related to this matter. He said their financial obligations to the business 
were joint, the SBA loan account was joint, and they filed joint income tax returns. He said 
the debt came to his wife, she pays $1,500 monthly, and her payment goes directly to the 
IRS. (Tr. 115,119-129; Tr2. 15-18) He submitted documents downloaded from the IRS 
website, which indicated payments of $1,500 were being made towards tax indebtedness. 
(AE F) However, the documents lacked specificity , and were in sufficient to show 
payments are being made to satisfy this tax. (AE F)

SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n (failed to timely file 2020, 2021, 2022 federal tax returns): 
Applicant admitted he failed to timely file federal income taxes for at least tax years 2020, 
2021, and 2022. He said he filed his 2018 income tax returns in 2020 , and his 2019 
income tax returns in 2021. He also said he filed his 2020 income tax returns in “late 
2022.” (Tr. 125-127) However, during the second hearing, he claimed he filed his 2020, 
2021, and 2022 income tax return s – all three, in May 2024, just before his second 
hearing. (Tr2. 22-31; AE E) 
Applicant said a certified public accountant (CPA) prepared joint income tax 
returns on their behalf for 15 years, but that he mailed the returns. All three tax returns 
had different signature dates in May 2024, and return receipts for these income tax returns 
were not provided. All three returns showed significant refunds were due to Applicant and 
his wife , but were retained by the IRS . (AE E ; Tr2. 30 -31) Applicant said he did not 
anticipate ever receiving the refunds shown on the returns due to other tax obligations he 
could owe. (Tr2. 25-29) 
Applicant submitted documents indicating he filed six-month automatic extension 
requests for their 2020 and 2021 income tax returns, but not 2022. (AE E) He said he was 
not sure the IRS would accept the federal income tax returns. He did not present any 
documents or information about their state income tax returns. No federal or state tax 
transcripts were provided. Though Applicant disclosed the S2 business tax issue in his 
SCA, he did not disclose any personal income tax issues . It was only at the end of the 
first hearing the government became aware that he had other undisclosed personal 
income tax issues. (GE 1; Tr. 115-129; Tr2. 22-31; AE E) 
Policies  
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan , 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” EO 10865 § 2. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
7 
 
 
     
        
   
 
 
        
            
         
        
  
 
    
   
        
        
      
        
       
          
 
 
      
         
          
     
           
        
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” EO 10865 § 7. 
Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has 
not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burde n of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. “Substantial 
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington 
Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a 
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed 
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15 -01253 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01 -20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan at 531. See also AG 
¶ 2(b). 
Analysis  
Guideline  F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure  to  live  within  one’s means, satisfy debts,  and  meet  financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to   
protect  classified  or  sensitive information.  Financial distress can  also be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of,  other  
issues of  personnel security concern  such  as  excessive gambling, mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol abuse  or dependence. An  
individual who  is financially overextended  is at greater risk of having  to  
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to  generate funds.

This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
AG ¶  19(a): inability to  satisfy debts;  
AG ¶  19(c): a  history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
AG ¶  19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to  pay annual Federal, state, or local income  
tax as required.  
The SOR allegations are established by the evidence, including Applicant’s SOR 
admissions, credit bureau reports, income tax documents, his background investigation, 
and admissions made in both hearings. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
AG ¶  20(a):  the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or  
occurred  under such  circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur and does not 
cast doubt  on  the  individual's current  reliability, trustworthiness, or good  
judgment;  
AG ¶   20(b): the  conditions that resulted  in  the  financial problem  were  largely 
beyond  the  person's control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business  
downturn, unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death, divorce  or separation,  
clear victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices, or identity  theft),  and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
AG ¶  20(c):  the  individual has  received  or is receiving  financial counseling  
for the  problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as a  non-profit 
credit counseling  service, and  there  are clear indications  that the  problem 
is being resolved or is under control;   
AG ¶  20(d): the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve  debts;

AG ¶  20(e): the  individual has a  reasonable basis to  dispute  the  legitimacy  
of the  past-due  debt which  is the  cause  of the  problem  and  provides  
documented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or provides  
evidence of actions to  resolve the issue; and  
AG ¶  20(g): the  individual has made  arrangements with  the  appropriate  tax  
authority to  file or pay  the  amount owed  and  is in  compliance  with  those  
arrangements.  
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) are not established. Though some of Applicant’s debts have 
been resolved or are being resolved, he has significant unresolved financial problems, 
including tax issues. He has taken positive steps towards addressing some of his debts, 
but his evidence is insufficient to find that his financial problems are behind him and will 
be resolved in a reasonable time. He did not present evidence that he received or is 
receiving financial counseling, and his financial problems are not under control. 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant and his wife experienced success as 
entrepreneurs after selling a previous business to a private equity firm in 2009 , earning 
$3 million in profit. However, they experienced massive business and personal financial 
losses from the failure of their three hair salon businesses in 2019 , an area in which 
neither were experienced. He attributed his overall financial situation to the failure of these 
businesses, followed by poor economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Applicant shuttered his businesses in 2019, before the start of the pandemic. Economic 
conditions did not prevent them from paying employee withholding taxes or from timely 
filing their income tax returns. 
Applicant took a huge risk and made a seri es of financial missteps by starting 
businesses that neither he nor his wife had experience in, and then he continued to 
finance two (S1, S3) of the businesses that were failing financially, at the expense of one 
(S2), that was quite profitable. He continued to use the bulk of his financial assets , 
including collateralizing his three properties, to keep the failing businesses afloat. These 
actions were not reasonable or responsible under the circumstances. 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant is credited with taking positive steps 
to repay some overdue creditors and resolve some delinquent debts, and for resolving or 
being in the process of resolving five of his delinquent debts. However, he has significant 
unresolved debts and tax issues, and he has been unable to “stay the course” with several 
of his consumer creditors. Debt obligations are not absolved, per se, by any creditor’s 
sale, discharge, or non-collectability of a debt. 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not fully established. Applicant successfully disputed the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.g, which is mitigated. Applicant said he disputed the amount of the SBA loan, not the 
debt itself. He did not believe he was fully credited for collaterals sold against the SBA 
loan. However, he did not present proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute, and there 
was no mechanism to otherwise evaluate his claim. The mere assertion that a debt is 
denied or disputed is insufficient to establish the legitimate dispute of a debt.

AG ¶ 20(g) is not established. Applicant has failed to timely file his federal income 
tax returns since at least 2018. Though he claimed he has worked with the same certified 
CPA for 15-years, he initially said he filed his 2018 federal income tax returns in 2020; his 
2019 federal returns in 2021, and his federal 2020 returns in 2022. However, he submitted 
evidence that showed he did not complete his 2020, 2021, or 2022 returns until May 2024, 
just prior to his second hearing. 
Applicant’s CPA assisted him and his wife with completing their joint income tax 
returns, and Applicant filed them, but he did not know whether the IRS accepted them. 
No federal or state income tax transcripts were offered or presented as evidence in this 
case. Whether one is owed a refund or has to pay a deficit balance is immaterial, and 
independent of the duty to file income tax returns as re quired. Significant questions 
remain about the overall status of Applicant’s federal and state income taxes. 
Overall, t here is insufficient evidence to determin e that Applicant’s financial 
problems are behind him. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to repay his debts. His financial issues 
continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and his ability and 
willingness to comply with government rules and regulations. I find that financial 
considerations security concerns remain unresolved in this case despite the presence of 
some mitigation. 
Whole-Person  Analysis   
Under the whole -person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant’s conduct and all 
the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  
and  other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  for the  conduct;  
(8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  (9) the  
likelihood  of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-
person analysis.

________________________ 
Overall, the  record evidence  leaves me  with  questions and  doubts about  
Applicant’s eligibility and  suitability for a  security clearance. I conclude  Applicant did  not  
mitigate  the  financial  considerations  security  concerns  and  has  not carried  his  burden  of  
showing  it is clearly consistent  with  the  national interest to grant  him  eligibility for access  
to classified information.  
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c, 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, 1.h:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g, 1i, 1.j:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k  - 1.n:  Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
