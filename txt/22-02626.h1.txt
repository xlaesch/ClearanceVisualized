Decision 
TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations ) security concerns are not mitigated . 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On November 9, 2021 , Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On November 17, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960 ); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992 ), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A , the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be g ranted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On

December 12, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR. On January 31, 2024, Department 
Counsel was ready to proceed. On February 6, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On 
February 12, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
scheduling the hearing on March 1, 2024. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits into evidence , 
and Applicant did not offer any exhibits into evidence . (Tr. 11-12; GE 1 -GE 7) All 
proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 11-12) On March 
14, 2024, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. The record was closed on March 1, 
2024. (Tr. 77) 
Some  details were  excluded  to  protect Applicant’s right to  privacy. Specific   
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 
1.e, 1.g, and 1.h. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. He also 
said the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c were the same debt, and the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e 
and 1.h were the same debt. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
Applicant is a 49-year-old aviation mechanic . (Tr. 12) He needs a security 
clearance to retain his employment. (Tr. 17 , 63-64) He came to the United States from 
Mexico in 1992 when he was 17 years old. (Tr. 18) In 1994, he graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 17) In 1995, he joined the Navy , and he honorably retired from the Navy in 
2015. (Tr. 18-19) His rate was aviation machinist mate first class. (Tr. 19) He was 
deployed to Iraq twice in 2005 and 2007 , to Kuwait once in 2007, and on carriers six 
times, which sailed in the vicinity of Iraq. (Tr. 19-21) Each deployment was for about two 
to three months. (Tr. 22) His Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating is 100 
percent. (Tr. 65-66) 
Applicant was married from 1997 to 2020. (Tr. 22) His son is 15 and his other two 
children from his marriage are 18 or older. (Tr. 22, 24) His former spouse receives half 
of his military retirement , which is about $1,000 a month . (Tr. 25) He also pays $500 
monthly in child support to his former spouse. (Tr. 25) He pays $250 a month to support 
a 19-year-old daughter from a relationship outside of his marriage, and he pays $700 a 
month for tuition for a 20-year-old daughter from a relationship outside of his marriage. 
(Tr. 27-29) 
Financial Considerations  
Applicant was unemployed from June of 2015 to April of 2016 and from November 
of 2021 to May of 2022. (Tr. 58) He said his financial problems began when he was 
divorced in 2020. (Tr. 32) He said he received responsibility for all of the marital debts. 
(Tr. 32) Later, he said the divorce decree said his former spouse was responsible for 
part or all of some of the SOR debts. (Tr. 62) His former spouse is a food attendant in a 
school. (Tr. 33-34) He has taken responsibility for the SOR debts because he is on the 
2 
 
 
                                         
 
          
  
 
 
     
 
 
        
           
       
        
           
  
 
 
 
 
       
         
 
 
      
 
   
 
       
        
 
 
contracts with the creditors, and he does not believe his former spouse will pay anything 
to address the debts listed in his divorce decree. He received financial counseling when 
he was in the Navy. (Tr. 62) 
The November 17, 2023 SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling $68,259, and 
their status is as follows: 
SOR ¶ 1.a through 1.e , 1.g, and 1.h allege seven delinquent debts totaling 
$67,429 owed to the same credit union for $21,275, $12,795, $12,550, $8,867, $4,720, 
$2,598, and $4,624, respectively. Applicant said the credit union is not working with him 
to establish a reasonable payment plan. (Tr. 35) His most recent payments on the debts 
were in June 2022 for the $21,275 debt and in November 2023 for the other credit union 
debts. (Tr. 36-47; GE 4) He did not remember the amount of his most recent payments. 
(Tr. 36-47) 
The  credit-union  creditor advised  Applicant that he  was only paying  interest, and  
he  was not reducing  the  amount of the  loans. (Tr. 37) He stopped  paying  the  creditor  
because  he  believed  he  was  not making  progress  reducing  the  amount  of  the  debts.  (Tr. 
37)  He was unable  to  borrow funds to  pay  the  debt because  of  his bad  credit.  (Tr. 37)  
He attempted  to  consolidate  the  debts and  obtain  a  payment plan  for the  credit union  
debts in  2023; however, the  creditor would  not agree  to  his proposals. (Tr. 39, 72) 
Applicant believes that he  has five  accounts with  the  credit union  instead  of seven  
accounts indicated  in the  SOR. (Tr. 52)  He believed  the  debt for $4,720  may be  incorrect 
because  a  vehicle  was repossessed.  (Tr. 50-52)  His plan  for the  future is to  continue  to  
ask the  credit  union  to  combine  the  debts,  and  then  he  will  try to  establish  a  payment  
plan with the credit union. (Tr. 61)  
Applicant credibly stated  he  had  five  debts owed  to  the  credit union. In  his SOR 
response, he  said  SOR ¶¶  1.b  ($12,795) and  1.c ($12,550) duplicated  each  other. He  
also said SOR ¶¶  1.e  ($4,720)  and  1.h  ($4,624) were  the  same  debt.  SOR ¶¶  1.b  and  
1.e  are mitigated  as duplications.  In  sum, he  has five  delinquent  debts owed  to  the  
creditor totaling  $49,914.  
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $202. Appellant said he 
paid the debt, and his credit report reflects the debt was paid in August 2023. (Tr. 47-48, 
57; GE 4) 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $401. 
Applicant was unaware of this debt. (Tr. 54) He called the creditor, and the creditor was 
unable to give him information on the debt. (Tr. 55, 57) 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $153. 
Applicant said he was responsible for this debt, and he said he could pay it off today. (Tr. 
55-57)

SOR ¶ 1.k alleges an account placed for collection for $74. Applicant said he had 
an account with the creditor, and he needed to investigate the basis of the debt. (Tr. 56) 
If the debt is valid, then he said he would pay it. (Tr. 56) 
Applicant’s monthly net income, including VA disability and Navy retirement pay, 
is about $11,000. (Tr. 67) He has a monthly remainder of several thousand dollars after 
paying support, alimony, rent, and other expenses. (Tr. 70) 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority 
to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether 
an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. 
The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information . 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant ’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531.

“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant ’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once  the  Government establishes a  disqualifying  condition  by substantial 
evidence, the  burden  shifts to  the  applicant to  rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate  the  
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the  ultimate burden of demonstrating  that it  
is clearly consistent with  the  national interest  to  grant or continue  his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR   Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd. Dec. 19,  2002). The  burden  of 
disproving  a  mitigating  condition  never shifts  to  the  Government.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  
02-31154  at 5  (App.  Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance  determinations should err,  
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to  live  within  one’s means, satisfy debts, and  meet financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness to  abide  by rules  and  regulations, all  of which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness,  and  ability to  
protect classified  or sensitive information. Financial distress can  also  be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus  can  be  a  possible  indicator  of,  other  
issues of personnel security  concern such  as  excessive  gambling, mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol  abuse  or dependence. An  
individual  who  is financially overextended  is  at  greater  risk of  having  to  
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to  generate funds.  
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than  the  possibility that an  applicant might  
knowingly  compromise  classified  information  in order to  raise  money in  
satisfaction  of his or her debts. Rather, it requires  a  Judge  to  examine  the  
totality of an  applicant’s financial history and  circumstances.  The  Judge  
must consider pertinent evidence  regarding  the  applicant’s self-control,  
judgment,  and  other qualities  essential to  protecting  the  national secrets  
as well as the  vulnerabilities inherent in  the  circumstances.  The  Directive 
presumes a  nexus  between  proven  conduct under any  of the  Guidelines  
and  an  applicant’s security eligibility.

AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case , “(a) inability to satisfy debts” and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” 
“[A]  single  debt  can  be  sufficient  to  raise  Guideline  F security concerns.” ISCR   
Case  No.  19-02667  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Nov.  3,  2021) (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  14-05366  at 3  
(App.  Bd. Feb.  5,  2016)). “Additionally, a  single  debt  that  remains  unpaid  over  a  period  
of years can properly be characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Id.  
The record establishes the disqualifying condition s in AG ¶ ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). 
Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required . 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions are contained in the mitigation section, infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 , which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ag o, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur and  does not cast 
doubt on  the  individual’s current   reliability, trustworthiness,   or  good  
judgment;  
(b) the  conditions that resulted  in the  fina ncial problem  were  largely beyond  
the  person’s control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business downturn, 
unexpected  medical emergency, a  death, divorce  or separation, clear 
victimization  by  predatory lending  practices,  or identity  theft),  and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has  received  or  is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as  a  non-profit  credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is  
being resolved or is under control;  
(d) the  individual initiated  and  is a dhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and  
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue. 
The  Appeal Board in ISCR  Case  No.  10-04641  at 4  (App. Bd.  Sept.  24, 2013)  
explained  Applicant’s responsibility for  proving  the  applicability of  mitigating  conditions  
as follows:  
Once  a  concern arises regarding  an  Applicant’s security clearance   
eligibility,  there is a  strong  presumption  against  the  grant or maintenance  
6 
 
 
                                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
         
    
          
       
 
 
 
       
         
      
          
  
 
   
 
 
of a  security clearance.  See  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913  F. 2d  1399, 1401  (9th
Cir. 1990),  cert.  denied, 499  U.S. 905  (1991).  After the  Government
presents  evidence  raising  security concerns, the  burden  shifts to  the
applicant to  rebut or mitigate  those  concerns.  See  Directive ¶  E3.1.15. The
standard applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions is that articulated  in
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning  personnel being  considered  for
access to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in favor of  the  national
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2  ¶ 2(b).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply to the debts which were delinquent when the SOR was 
issued. “It is also well established that an applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts demonstrate 
a continuing course of conduct and can be viewed as recent for purposes of the 
Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017)). 
Applicant  provided  some  mitigating  information  under AG  ¶ 20(b). Applicant was  
unemployed  from  June  of 2015  to  April of 2016  and  from  November of 2021  to  May of  
2022. He said his financial problems began  when  he  was divorced  in 2020. These  are  
circumstances  partially  or fully beyond  his  control. However,  “[e]ven  if  [an  applicant’s]  
financial  difficulties initially arose, in  whole  or in part, due  to  circumstances  outside  his  
[or her] control,  the  [administrative  judge]  could  still  consider whether  [the  applicant]  has 
since  acted  in a  reasonable manner when  dealing  with  those  financial difficulties.” ISCR  
Case  No.  05-11366  at  4  n.9  (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  03-13096  
at 4  (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR  Case  No. 99-0462  at 4  (App. Bd. May  25, 2000); 
ISCR  Case  No.  99-0012  at 4  (App. Bd. Dec.  1, 1999)). He  did not establish  mitigation  
under AG ¶  20(b) because  he  failed  to  prove  that he  acted  responsibly  under  the  
circumstances. The  connections of the  adverse  circumstances to  his delinquent debts, 
and  the  financial costs of  these  circumstances are  unclear.  He  had  the  financial  
resources to  make more progress on his SOR debts.  
“[U]ntil an applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as 
a matter of law that he has initiated a good -faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolved debts. The phrase ‘meaningful track record ’ necessarily includes 
evidence of actual debt reduction through payment on debts.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007)). 
In ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. June 7, 2019) the Appeal Board said: 
As we  have previously stated, the  timing of resolution of financial problems  
is an  important  factor  in evaluating  an  applicant’s case  for mitigation  
because  an  applicant who  takes  action  to  resolve financial  problems only  
after being  placed  on  notice  his or her clearance  is in jeopardy may lack the  
judgment,  and  self-discipline  to  follow rules and  regulations over time  or

Applicant  did not  make  any progress  resolving  the  five  delinquent  debts  in  SOR  
¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,  1.d, 1.g, and  1.h  totaling  $49,914  owed  to  the  same  credit-union  creditor.  He  
did not make  any payments to  the  credit-union  creditor after November 2023. He does  
not have  a  payment plan  on  the  five  debts. He is credited  with  paying  the  debt in SOR ¶  
1.f  ($202). He did not  recognize the  debt in  SOR ¶  1.i ($401),  and  the  creditor was unable  
to  locate  his account information. He has not made  enough  payments or taken  sufficient 
actions  to  resolve  debts to  establish a  “meaningful  track record”  of debt resolution. I am  
not confident that he  will  maintain his financial responsibility based  on  his history of  
having financial problems.  Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole -person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature, extent,  and  seriousness  of the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the  frequency and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the  time  of the  conduct; (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of 
rehabilitation  and  other  permanent behavioral  changes;  (7) the  motivation  
for the  conduct; (8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood  of continuation  or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. M y comments under 
Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is a 49 -year-old aviation mechanic. In 1994, he graduated from high 
school. In 1995, he joined the Navy, and he honorably retired from the Navy in 2015. His 
rate was aviation machinist mate first class. He was deployed to Iraq twice in 2005 and 
2007, to Kuwait once in 2007, and on carriers six times, which sailed in the vicinity of 
Iraq. Each deployment was for about two to three months. His VA disability rating is 100 
percent. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive. 
Applicant’s financial problems are detailed in the facts and financial considerations 
section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the evidence of mitigation. He 
did not establish that he was unable to make more timely and significant progress 
resolving his SOR debts. I am not convinced he will establish his financial responsibility. 
The financial evidence raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, 
and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18.

_______________________________ 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot 
or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the 
future. With more effort towards resolution of his debts and maintenance of his financial 
responsibility, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of h is security 
clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances 
in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations 
security concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F: AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph  1.a:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph  1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs  1.e and 1.f:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph  1.i:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs  1.j  and 1.k:  Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of 
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access 
to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
