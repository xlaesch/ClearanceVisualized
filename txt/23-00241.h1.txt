Decision 
PRICE, Eric C., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On November 11, 2021, Applicant submitted a security clearance application 
(SCA). On March 24, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F. The action was taken under Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines 
(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. 
Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on April 28, 2023, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 
2024. On April 5, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing scheduling the hearing via video teleconference. I convened the hearing 
as scheduled on May 9, 2024. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1

through 5. Applicant testified and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through E. I held the 
record open to permit Applicant to submit additional documents. He timely submitted AE 
F through L. I sustained Applicant’s objection to GE 5 (summary report of his March 2022 
interview with a government investigator) and there were no other objections to the 
proffered exhibits. GE 1 through 4, and AE A through L, were admitted in evidence. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 20, 2024, and the record closed on June 17, 
2024. (Tr. 16-26, Hearing Exhibit V) 
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant is a 62-year-old program manager employed by federal contractor since 
September 2017. He works part -time as a driver for a ride -sharing company. He was a 
senior leader for another federal contractor from February 2007 to March 2017, but when 
the office closed, he chose not to relocate for personal and family reasons. From March 
to September 2017, he was unemployed. He served on active duty in the U.S. military 
from May 1984 until honorably retiring in April 2007. He has held a security clearance 
since 1985. (GE 1; AE A-B; Tr. 11-12, 27-40) 
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 1985 and a master’s degree in 1997. He 
married his second wife in 2023. He was previously married from 1987 to 2023 and has 
two adult children from that marriage. (GE 1; AE C-D; Tr. 38-39) 
The SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $247,436. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h). In Applicant's Answer, he admitted all SOR allegations with 
explanations. 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to overspending on an extramarital 
affair, unemployment, underemployment, his former wife’s unemployment, family living 
expenses, and divorce. He incurred the debts alleged in the SOR by using personal credit 
to pay his then mistress’s expenses from early 2015 to late 2017. He subsequently agreed 
with his wife to stop paying the debts he incurred to support his former mistress. His gross 
income was more than $160,000 per year until March 2017. It decreased to about $85,000 
when he started with his current employer and increased to about $119,000 by 2023. (Tr. 
26-50; AE A) 
As part of their September 2023 divorce, Applicant and his former spouse agreed 
to list their marital home for sale on or before January 15, 2024. He estimated they had 
about $300,000 equity in the home. Under the agreement his former spouse would reside 
in the home, receive net proceeds from its sale, and, upon its sale, reimburse Applicant 
$300 for each month from September 2023 until the home was sold. Both children reside 
with his former spouse in the marital home, and his son’s health issues keep him close to 
home. Applicant has not attempted to enforce the agreement to list the property for sale. 
However, when the home is sold, he anticipates receiving $300 for each month she

resided in the home from September 2023 until its sale, and intends to apply those funds 
towards his debts. (AE C; Tr. 27-43, 81-86, 115-116) 
In early May 2024, Applicant enrolled 10 debts totaling $254,879 with a debt 
consolidation company (DCC) including debts alleged in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e. He did 
not enroll some other SOR debts because they “have aged out.” The remaining debts 
enrolled with the DCC were not alleged in the SOR, including three personal loans totaling 
$87,014 that Applicant obtained in 2023 for divorce costs and the maintenance of two 
households, and to pay off other unspecified debts. He testified that he was required to 
make payments of $1,511 to the DCC every two weeks and that he made his first payment 
on May 29, 2024. (Tr. 35-37, 62-65, 110-120; AE E) 
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. 
SOR ¶ 1.a: loan account in collection for $70,837. Credit reports from 
December 2021, January 2023, and April 2024 show the account was placed for 
collection for $70,837 in April 2018 and past due in that amount. (GE 2 at 2, GE 3 at 2, 
GE 4 at 5) In May 2024, this debt was enrolled with the DCC. (AE E) Applicant testified 
that his last payment on this loan was in 2017. (Tr. 53- 54, 98-99; AE E) This debt is 
unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit card charged off for $58,203 . Credit reports from December 
2021 and January 2023 show the account was charged off with balances of $59,696 and 
$58,203, respectively. (GE 2 at 2, GE 3 at 2) This debt was the subject of a $58,203 
judgement in 2019, that Applicant agreed to settle in 2022 with two payments. He made 
the first payment, $1,492 in May 2022, but did not make the second payment, $16,416 
by May 26, 2022, because his former spouse decided they should not sell their marital 
home. (Tr. 54-57, 99-101; AE J) He has made no additional payments on this debt since 
May 2022. This debt is unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit -card collection account for $33,761 . Credit reports from 
December 2021, January 2023, and April 2024 show the account was placed for 
collection for $33,761 in April 2018 and past due in that amount. (GE 2 at 3, GE 3 at 2, 
GE 4 at 9) Applicant acknowledged he has not made a payment on this debt since 2018. 
In May 2024, the DCC submitted an offer to resolve this debt for $13,504 and the creditor 
apparently accepted the offer. (AE E, AE I; Tr. 57- 58, 102- 121) He did not submit 
documentary evidence of any payments under the settlement agreement. 
SOR ¶ 1.d: credit card charged off for $7,314. Credit reports from December 
2021, January 2023, and April 2024 show the account was opened or assigned in June 
2016 and charged off with balances of $7,314, $7,314, and $0.00, respectively. (GE 2 at 
3, GE 3 at 2- 3, GE 4 at 10) Applicant testified this debt was incurred for his former 
mistress, that he had not made a payment on it since February 2018, and that he believed 
it had “termed out.” (Tr. 57-62, 102-104) This debt is not resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit card charged off for $7,256. Credit reports from December 
2021, January 2023, and April 2024 show the account was opened or assigned in 
December 2014 and charged off with a balance of $7,256. (GE 2 at 4, GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at

5) Applicant testified his last payment  on this  debt was in February  2018. In May 2024,  
he enrolled the debt with the DCC. (AE E) After the hearing, he submitted evidence of  an  
offer to settle the debt for $1,814 with up to six monthly payments. (AE K; Tr.  62-63, 104-
105) He did not submit documentary  evidence that the settlement  offer was  accepted or  
of payment  on this account.    
SOR ¶ 1.f: loan charged off for $30,000. Credit reports from December 2021 and 
January 2023 show the account was opened or assigned in April 2016 in the amount of 
$35,000, charged off with a balance of $0.00, and transferred to or purchased by another 
lender. (GE 2 at 5, GE 3 at 3 -4) Although this debt was transferred or sold to an 
unidentified creditor no later than December 2021, Applicant testified that he made no 
effort to resolve or pay this debt since 2017 and believed it had a zero balance because 
of its age. (Tr. 63, 106-108) This debt is not resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g: unsecured credit account charged off for $37,000. Credit reports 
from December 2021 and January 2023 show the account was opened or assigned in 
June 2016 in the amount of $50,000 and charged off with a balance of $0.00. (GE 2 at 5, 
GE 3 at 4) An April 2024 credit report shows the account with a high credit of $45,550, 
last payment in August 2017, and charged off with a balance of $0.00. (GE 4 at 11) 
Applicant acknowledged the account was charged off and that he had made no effort to 
resolve it since his last payment in 2017. (Tr. 63-64, 108) This debt is not resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.h: auto loan charged off for $3,065. Credit reports from December 
2021, January 2023, and April 2024 show the account was opened in October 2014, the 
vehicle was repossessed, and the loan was charged off with a balance of $3,065. (GE 2 
at 6, GE 3 at 4, GE 4 at 12) Applicant testified the vehicle was related to the affair, that 
he had not made any payments since 2017, and believed that $3,065 was the deficiency 
balance after the vehicle was sold at auction. (Tr. 108-110) This debt is unresolved. 
Applicant testified that his financial situation is not good but improving. He 
submitted a written budget that reflected he has $760 in funds available after monthly 
expenses. He reported net monthly income of $14,819 including his salary ($7,262), 
military retired pay ($5,257), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability 
compensation ($338), his current spouse’s income ($733), and money earned as a driver 
for a ride- sharing company ($1,229). He reported monthly expenses totaling $14,059 
including debt resolution ($3,024), spousal support to his former wife ($1,500), and a 
portion of his military retirement paid to his former wife ($2,628). He has a few thousand 
dollars in the bank, a $2,600 health savings account, and about $6,000 in a retirement 
account. He has not received formal financial counseling. (AE A, AE C at 5 -6, AE L; Tr. 
26-50, 73-89) 
Applicant submitted evidence he settled several debts not alleged in the SOR 
including debts of $575 and $334 in March 2022 (AE G -H), and a $21,668 debt on or 
before May 2022 (AE F; GE 2 at 3, GE 3 at 3) He pays about $700 a month under a 
payment plan for overdue federal income taxes for tax years 2015 through 2017 and 
2020. (Tr. 52-59, 87-89; AE C at 6, AE L) I informed him of the importance of submitting

documentary evidence of debt payments, efforts to contact creditors or to resolve or 
otherwise address delinquent debts. (Tr. 91-98, 113, 121-122) 
Applicant testified that, while on active duty, he worked in acquisitions or logistics 
for over 19 years, was part of major acquisition programs, commanded two units and 
served in leadership positions at several other commands, and had extensive experience 
in budgeting and planning requirements. Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, 
he was responsible for many significant matters including critical, time-sensitive upgrades 
to a national security asset. He earned decorations, medals, and other citations including 
three Meritorious Service Medals, two service Commendation Medals, Joint Service 
Commendation and Achievement Medals, and other personal and unit awards and 
citations. He also worked on challenging and innovative programs for a federal contractor 
from February 2007 to March 2017. (Tr. 27-43, 81-86; AE B) 
Policies  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in 
conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative judge 
must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and pres ent, 
favorable and unfavorable. 
“The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses  and other evidence to rebut,  
explain, extenuate, or  mitigate facts  admitted by the applicant or proven by Department  
Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of  persuasion as to obtaining a  favorable clearance 
decision.”  Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  An applicant “has  the ul timate burden of  demonstrating  
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security  
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance  
determinations should err, if they  must,  on the side of  denials.”  Department of the Navy  
v. Egan,  484 U.S.  518, 531 (1988);  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).  
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG 
¶ 2(b), any doubt “will be resolved in favor of the national security.” Section 7 of EO 10865 
provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 
3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about a person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or 
sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
Applicant’s admissions and record evidence, including credit bureau reports, 
establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy 
debts) and AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). The following 
mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
under s
uch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  proble m were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;   
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and   
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
6 
 
 
 
    
    
   
   
 
     
    
  
 
    
 
    
    
 
   
  
    
  
 
      
  
     
  
 
 
   
    
  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue.  
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Although Applicant’s behavior resulting in his 
delinquent debts happened long ago and is unlikely to recur, the delinquent debts are 
long-standing, ongoing, and continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment. 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant’s decision to use personal credit to 
financially support his then mistress for more than two years was within his control. His 
former spouse’s unemployment, family expenses, his divorce, and his unemployment and 
underemployment were conditions largely beyond his control. However, he has not 
produced sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(e) are not established. Applicant denied receiving financial 
counseling and did not dispute the legitimacy of any delinquent debt alleged in the SOR. 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d and 1.f 
through 1.h. These debts are long-standing, and except for a $1,500 payment on the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b in May 2022, he has made no effort to repay or otherwise resolve 
these debts since at least February 2018. 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not fully established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c and 1.e. 
Although Applicant entered an agreement with a DCC to attempt to address these debts 
in May 2024, and even assuming he has paid some or all of these debts, the timing of his 
actions is insufficient to fully establish that he adhered to a good faith effort to resolve 
these debts. The timing of an Applicant’s actions, including repayment of delinquent 
debts, impacts the degree to which the mitigating factors apply. ISCR Case No. 08-06058 
at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Waiting to pay legitimate debts until forced to do so by the 
security clearance process does not constitute good-faith debt resolution. See ISCR Case 
No. 10-05909 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

_____________________________ 
I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). I found Appl icant’s testimony to be 
sincere and credible. I considered his age, highly successful military career, work history, 
security clearance history, and that his financial problems were caused in part by 
conditions beyond his control. I also considered that his financial problems were largely 
attributable to his decision to provide financial support to his then mistress for more than 
two years, and that he has not attempted to pay or otherwise resolve five of those debts 
since at least February 2018. I also considered that he enrolled three of the eight debts 
alleged in the SOR with a DCC in May 2024, made offers to settle two of them shortly 
thereafter, and that one of those offers was accepted by the creditor. 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With a longer track record of financial responsibility, he may be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. Overall, the record evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance at this time. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  
  AGAI
NST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:   Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
