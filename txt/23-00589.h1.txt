Decision 
PRICE, Eric C., Administrative Judge: 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
Statement of the Case  
On August 4, 2022, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). 
On April 19, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken 
under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after 
June 8, 2017. 
Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on May 3, 2023, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 10, 2024. 
On August 9, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
scheduling the hearing via video teleconference on August 29, 2024. On August 15, 2024, 
Department Counsel amended the SOR. On August 26, 2024 , Applicant’s request to 
reschedule the hearing was granted. On October 3, 2024 , DOHA issued a notice

rescheduling the hearing and I convened the hearing as rescheduled on October 24, 
2024. Applicant responded to the SOR Amendments during the hearing . ( SOR 
Amendment; Transcript (Tr.) 12-15) 
Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit s (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant 
testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. The record was held open so 
Applicant could submit additional documentary evidence . She timely submitted AE G 
through R. GE 1 through 5 and AE A through R were admitted in evidence without 
objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 1 , 202 4. The record 
originally closed on November 18, 2024. I reopened the record from February 27, 2025 
to March 14, 2025 to provide Applicant an opportunity to provide additional documentary 
evidence; however, for reasons unclear from the record she did not respond to emails. 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) IV) 
Findings of Fact  
The SOR, as amended, alleges 17 delinquent accounts totaling $77,436, including 
$52,581 in delinquent student loans and a foreclosure. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1. q) In her 
response to the SOR and at hearing, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanation 
except SOR ¶ 1.l, which she denied. (Answer; Tr. 12-15) Her admissions are incorporated 
in my findings of fact. 
Applicant is a 61-year-old logistics support specialist employed by a federal 
contractor since October 2006 . She operated a small interior decorating business from 
2016 to 2020 and hopes to restart the business in 2025. She honorably served on active 
duty in the Army from October 1981 to August 1992 and in the Army Reserve from August 
1992 to August 1994. She is twice divorced (1991 and 2006) and has three adult children, 
ages 41, 33 and 31. She has earned numerous college credits but has not obtained a 
degree. She has held a security clearance since at least 1997. (GE 1; Tr. 19-23, 48-59, 
148-151; AE H) 
Applicant attributes h er  financial problems to  underemployment, medical costs  
from  contracting  COVID-19 four  times  and  other medical problems, monthly  prescription  
costs of up  to  $2,000,  divorce, and  costs associated  with  raising  three  children  as  a  single  
parent,  including  signing  for her youngest daughter’s student loans.  She  was paid by her  
employer when  she  missed  work because  of illness,  including  COVID 19. (Tr. 159-162)  
She  addressed  smaller debts first because  of her limited  financial resources. Since  
receiving  $36,000  in retroactive  disability benefits from  the  Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) in August  2024,  she has  paid  some  larger debts,  and  has paid or is  resolving  all  
debts alleged  in the  SOR except one.  (Answer; Tr. 23, 30-35, 48-55, 68-71, 92-93, 142-
143, 150-164, 181;  AE D, AE I, AE L, AE N)

 The evidence concerning  the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.  
 SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.c: student  loans  in  collection for $23,128, $17,756, and $11,697.  
Applicant admitted  the  allegations and  reported  all  three  accounts were in good  standing.  
(Answer) From  August  2014  to  November 2016, she  obtained  three  Parent Plus  student  
loans to  help pay for her daughter’s education ; loan  payments were  deferred  until after 
 
 
 
 
 
      
      
            
        
    
          
          
         
           
   
 
     
          
      
          
      
        
         
          
          
           
           
            
             
              
           
      
 
 On  August  19, 2024, Applicant applied  for the  “Fresh  Start”  program  to  get her  
student loans  out of default. (AE  A;  Tr. 40-41, 81-82, 169-170) In  October 2024,  she 
received  a  payment schedule from  the  loan  servicer showing  a 120-month  repayment  
plan  with  monthly payments totaling  $645, with  the  first payment due  on  November 14,  
2024. (AE  J) Applicant’s daughter is supposed  to  pay half of the  monthly payments.  (Tr.  
172-173) As of October 2024, Applicant had  paid about $4,843  of interest  on  the  student  
loans.  (AE  J at  5)  An  October  2024  credit  report  shows  the  accounts  as  current  with  
balances of $24,699, $19,017, and  $12,439,  respectively. (AE  A, AE  F at 59-61; Tr. 40-
41, 69-88,  111-113, 145-146,  166-173)  
her daughter graduated  in December 2018. (Tr. 167-168;  GE  5  at 3;  AE  J at 5) She  made  
payments  from  early  2019  to  April 2020  and  has not  made  a payment  since  because  of  
financial  inability, health  concerns  including  contracting  COVID-19  on  three  occasions, 
the  COVID 19  pause  on  payments,  and  applications  for student loan  forgiveness. (Tr. 79-
88,111-113; GE  4  at 4) A September 2022  credit report shows the  student loans were  
placed for collection  in  the  amounts alleged in the  SOR. (GE 3  at 2-3)  
SOR ¶ 1. d: credit account in collection for $11,349. Applicant admitted the 
allegation. (Answer) Credit reports from September 2022 and August 2024 show this loan 
account was placed for collection of $11,349 and past due for $6,689 with a balance of 
$15,716, respectively. Applicant used the loan to pay her mortgage. The creditor filed a 
civil suit in December 2018 and obtained a judgement against Applicant in April 2019 . 
She said she was unaware of the lawsuit until she went to settle the debt in August 2024. 
She did not make payments on the debt or communicate with the creditor from 2018 until 
August 2024 because she could not afford to pay it. She “fully satisfied” the judgement in 
August 2024 using funds she received from the VA . (GE 3 at 4, GE 4 at 2 ; AE C, AE M; 
Tr. 42-43, 82-88, 173-176) This debt is resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e: loan charged off for $4,536. Applicant admitted the allegation noting 
she had not resolved this debt but unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a payment plan with 
the creditor on multiple occasions. (Answer; Tr. 23-24) Credit reports from September 
2022 and August 2024 show this secured loan account was charged off for $3,809, and 
past due for $4,536 and $5,106, respectively. An October 2024 credit report shows the 
last payment was in April 2021, that the account was c harged off and had a current 
balance of $5,154. The credit report noted that adverse information typically remains on 
a credit report for seven years from the date of delinquency , and that the debt would be 
removed from her credit report in about May 2025. Applicant testified she made payments 
until April 2021 but could not afford to continue making payments because of medical 
expenses. She contacted the creditor in 2023 and August 2024 and offered to turn over 
a 2004 vehicle which secured the loan but was told the account had been charged off. 
She offered to pay the debt , but a creditor representative told her it would not make a 
difference because it had been charged off . She has not received an IRS form 1099 -C 
but submitted a copy of the vehicle title used to secure the loan that the creditor mailed 
to her. (GE 3 at 4, GE 4 at 2; AE D, AE F at 7, 39-40; Tr. 23-24, 43, 88- 176-181)

 SOR ¶  1.f: telecommunications account  placed  for collection of  $2,582. 
Applicant admitted the  allegation, said she  established  a payment plan  in April 2023 and  
 
 
 
          
         
        
   
 
       
          
 
 
        
        
          
        
         
         
        
          
   
 
        
       
            
         
        
      
     
         
      
         
          
   
 
      
          
             
 
 
had made required $50 monthly payments since then. She submitted evidence of a $50 
payment in October 2024 that reduced the balance to $1,950 . A September 2022 credit 
report shows this account was assigned in December 2021 and later placed for collection 
of $2,582. (Answer; AE K; Tr. 93-96, 181-182; GE 3 at 4) This debt is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g: insurance account placed for collection of $319. Applicant admitted 
the allegation, said she paid the debt in February 2023, and a credit report shows it was 
paid in February 2023. (Answer; Tr. 96-99; GE 4 at 2; AE L) This debt is resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.k: medical accounts placed for collection of $109, $61, $50, and 
$26, respectively. Applicant admitted the allegations and reported she had paid each 
debt. (Answer) She testified she first learned the debts were overdue during a November 
2022 background interview and paid all four debts in December 2022. A September 2022 
credit report shows th ese debts in collection for the amounts alleged. The first thre e 
accounts were opened or assigned from February 2020 to January 2022, and the fourth 
account was opened or assigned in November 2018. (GE 3 at 5 -6) The debts do not 
appear on the August or October 2024 credit reports. (GE 4-5; Tr. 99-101; AE D, AE F) 
These allegations are resolved for Applicant. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.o: property foreclosure in about 2019 and $1,099 past due 
on mortgage account in August 2024. Applicant denied her property had been 
foreclosed upon in 2019, admitted she had been past due on a mortgage when renters 
failed to pay their rent, and said her home mortgage was current. (Answer) Credit reports 
from April 2017 to October 2024 show a mortgage account was opened in March 2006, 
delinquent 120 days or more in early 2019, that foreclosure proceedings were started, 
and that the mortgage was sold to another mortgagee in about April 2019. Applicant has 
been past due on payments for her current mortgagee several times since 2019 but at 
the time of the hearing the account was current. (GE 1 at 37, GE 2 at 4, GE 3 at 7, GE 4 
at 1; AE F at 23-31; Tr. 14, 101-103, 117-119, 128-129) Applicant rebutted SOR ¶ 1.l that 
her pro perty was foreclosed upon in 2019 and resolved the August 2024 past-due 
balance on her mortgage, SOR ¶ 1.o, in part with funds received from the VA. 
SOR ¶ 1.m: auto loan account past due $1,879, with a total balance of $2,624. 
Applicant admitted the allegation, stated she paid the debt, and submitted documentary 
evidence it was settled in full on or before February 23, 2023. (Answer; GE 4 at 2; AE B, 
AE F at 31-32; Tr. 103-107) This debt is resolved. 
SOR ¶  1.n: wages  garnished in about  2019  for $2,500. Applicant reported  a  
garnishment for $2,500  in 2019  in  her August 2022  SCA  and  admitted  the  allegation. She  
reported  her wages were  garnished  for several months by the  federal government  until a  
debt was paid. It  is unclear from  the  record if the  garnishment was  related  to  a student  
loan  or tax  debt because  there  is no  documentary evidence  of  a garnishment,  an  
underlying  debt,  or resolution  thereof. Applicant testified  the  underlying  issue  was whether  
her daughter  qualified  as a full-time  student  when  she  did not attend  college  for about  
three  months  because  of  a  medical  issue. She  said  the  IRS  concluded  her daughter did  
not qualify as a  dependent  during  that timeframe, recalculated  her TY 2016  taxes  and  
determined  she  owed  $2,500.  She said she  later  demonstrated  her daughter was a  full-

time  student but her request for  reimbursement was denied  in  2021  because  it was  
beyond  the  statute  of limitations for refunds. (Answer; GE  1  at 36-37, GE  5  at 3; Tr. 79-
82, 107-117, 143-147, 183) This debt is resolved.  
SOR ¶¶ 1.p-1.q: electric account charged off for $69 and water account past 
due for about $276 . Applicant admitted the allegation s, reported she paid both debts, 
and submitted evidence they were paid in full in August 2024. Credit reports from August 
and October 2024 reflect the electric account was charged off for $69 and that the water 
account was placed for collection of $276 in mid-2023. Applicant said she initially did not 
pay the bills because she had not resided at the property when the bills were incurred. 
She was unable to persuade the property owner to pay the bills, so she paid them to get 
them removed from her credit report with funds she received from the VA. (GE 4 at 5; AE 
F at 31-32; Tr. 14, 103-107, 119-123) These debts are resolved. 
Applicant’s VA disability claim was initially denied in 2014, and she filed 
supplemental claims and appeals. In decisions from May to July 2024, the VA granted 
disability claims retroactive to March 2013. (AE I) In August 2024, she received $36,000 
in retroactive disability benefits from the VA . She testified her final disability rating was 
40%, and that she would receive about $753 monthly starting in July 2026, after offsets 
for compensation she received for early release from active duty in 1992. She received 
financial counseling while in the Army and has been taking financial planning and 
business courses since December 2023. (AE D, AE I, AE N , AE Q-R; Tr. 53-55, 66-67, 
92-93, 142-143, 150-151, 181) 
An August 2024 credit report shows Applicant incurred three delinquent debts after 
receiving the SOR including two utility bills totaling $345 (SOR ¶¶ 1.p-1.q) and was one 
month late on her mortgage for $1,099 (SOR ¶ 1.o) . Her financial circumstances have 
significantly improved since she received retroactive VA disability benefits in August 2024 
and used the funds to pay some debts alleged in the SOR and one debt not alleged in 
the SOR, delinquent state business taxes for TY 2020 totaling $7,499. (Tr. 146-148) She 
testified she had $5,043 of the VA funds remaining at the hearing . Her October 2024 
credit report shows only one delinquent debt (SOR ¶ 1.e - $5,054) and notes it should be 
removed from her report in May 2025. (AE F at 39-40) She earns about $70,000 a year 
in gross income and receives about $1,000 per month from her daughters. Prior to August 
2024, she had about $200 a month after expenses to apply towards her debts and she 
has had about $500 a month since. She has about $7,500 in the bank, about $9,000 in a 
retirement account, and a pension that will pay about $293 per month after she turns 65. 
She has spent about $ 6,000 on antique furniture since 201 6 and estimated its value at 
about $350,000 but has been unable to sell any of it. She hopes to purchase a building 
for her interior decorating business and furniture if her applications for various grants are 
approved. (GE 4 at 1,5, GE 5 at 2; Tr. 52-71, 146-148, 156-157; AE F) 
Applicant submitted  character  letters  that comment favorably on  her  work ethic,  
leadership,  integrity,  reliability, trustworthiness,  and  performance  of fiduciary duties.  (AE  
O) During  the  hearing  Applicant was  informed  of the  importance  of providing  documentary  
evidence  of  debt payments,  contact with  creditors, efforts to  address or resolve h er

delinquent debts, and her current financial circumstances. (Tr. 15-16, 30-34, 151-157, 
171-173, 183-190) 
Policies  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible 
rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guide lines 
are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information abou t the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
“The  applicant is responsible  for presenting  witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  
explain, extenuate, or mitigate  facts admitted  by the  applicant or proven  by Department 
Counsel,  and  has the  ultimate  burden  of persuasion  as to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance  
decision.”  Directive ¶  E3.1.15.  An  applicant  “has the  ultimate  burden  of  demonstrating  
that it  is clearly consistent with  the  national  interest  to  grant or continue  his security  
clearance.” ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at 3  (App. Bd. Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance  
determinations should err, if they must,  on  the  side  of denials.” Department of the  Navy  
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see  AG ¶  2(b).  
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG 
¶ 2(b), any doubt “will be resolved in favor of the national security.” Section 7 of EO 10865 
provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 
3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  
Analysis 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations  
The  security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
Failure to   live  within  one’s means, satisfy debts,  and  meet  financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
6 
 
 
 
 
     
        
     
      
      
   
 
        
      
         
  
 
      
 
 
 
 
 
      
        
            
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to   
protect  classified  or  sensitive information.  Financial distress can  also be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of,  other  
issues of personnel security concern  such  as  excessive gambling  mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol abuse  or dependence. An  
individual who  is financially overextended  is at greater risk of having  to  
engage  in  illegal  or  otherwise questionable acts  to  generate  funds.  
Affluence  that cannot be  explained  by known  sources of income  is  also a  
security concern insofar as it may result from  criminal activity, including  
espionage.  
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about a person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or 
sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
The record evidence, including credit reports and Applicant’s admissions establish 
two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”) 
and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). Applicant refuted th e 
allegation that her home had been foreclosed upon in 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.l). 
The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur and  does not  cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   
(b) the  conditions  that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely  beyond  
the  person’s  control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business downturn,  
unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death,  divorce  or separation, clear  
victimization  by predatory lending  practices, or identity  theft), and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has received  or is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as  a  non-profit  credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is being  
resolved  or is under control; and  
(d) the  individual initiated  an d  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s underemployment, medical 
problems including contracting COVID-19 at least three times, prescription costs, divorce, 
and costs associated with raising three children as a single parent were conditions largely

beyond  her control. However, obtaining  parent plus student loans  to  help pay for her  
daughter’s  education  was  not.  Her decisions  to  address  smaller debts first because  of  her  
limited  financial resources, to  not make  student loan  payments while repayments were  
paused  due  to  COVID 19, to  apply for student loan  forgiveness, and,  in August 2024, to  
apply for the  “Fresh  Start”  program  to  get her student loans out of default  were  reasonable  
under the  circumstances. See  ISCR  Case  No. 20-02787  at 3  n.1  (App. Bd.  Mar. 2022)  
(“Under the  CARES  Act of  March 2020,  Federal student loans  were  placed  in  forbearance  
and collection on defaulted student loans was paused.”)    
Applicant resolved two delinquent debts totaling more than $2,319 on or before 
February 2023, (SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.m), entered an agreement to resolve a $2,582 debt in 
April 2023 and reduced that debt to $1,950 by October 2024 through payments (SOR ¶ 
1.f), and resolved delinquent medical debts totaling $246 sometime before August 2024 
(SOR ¶¶ 1. h through 1.k). She used VA disability benefits received in August 2024 to 
resolve an $11,349 judgment (SOR ¶ 1.d), a mortgage past-due for $1,099 (SOR ¶ 1.o), 
and two utility accounts past due for $345 (SOR ¶¶ 1.p-1.q). 
Applicant’s financial circumstances have significantly improved since receiving 
retroactive VA benefits in August 2024. She has resolved or is resolving her delinquent 
debts except for the student loan debt and the debt alleged in SOR 1(e). Although the 
lack of evidence regarding settlement negotiations and payments on the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1(e) raise some question as to whether she acted in good faith with respect to that 
debt, she credibly explained her unsuccessful efforts to establish a payment plan , 
submitted evidence the creditor returned the title of a vehicle securing that loan, and there 
is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts 
simultaneously. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). She has 
been approved for the Fresh Start program and plans to repay student loans she obtained 
to fund her daughter’s education with assistance from her daughters. I find she has made 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors and to resolve her financial issues. She 
received financial counseling and has been taking financial planning courses . I find that 
her finances do not cast doubt on h er current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative j udge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency  of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  
and  other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  for the  conduct;

(8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  (9) the  
likelihood  of continuation or recurrence.  
I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). I considered the entire record, including 
Applicant’s work history, lengthy security clearance history, and that h er financial 
problems were caused, in part, by circumstances beyond h er control. I also considered 
her limited resources, her efforts to resolve her debts both before and after she received 
retroactive benefits from the VA in August 2024, and her eligibility for future VA benefits. 
Applicant does not have a stellar financial record, but she has made an earnest 
effort to resolve her delinquent debts and to not accrue additional debt. She understands 
that she needs to pay her debts including student loans to retain a security clearance and 
I believe she is committed to doing so. She was sincere and credible at the hearing. The 
record evidence establishes a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment and does not 
leave me with questions or doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns 
arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:   FOR  APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.q:  For  Applicant   
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is granted.
