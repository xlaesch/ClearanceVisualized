Decision  
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
The security concerns raised under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On September 14, 2023, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and 
Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 
1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix 
A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Positi on (AGs), effective June 8, 
2017. 
The SOR detailed reasons why DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
 
 
 
 
     
         
    
               
        
           
        
   
 
         
     
      
          
     
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
         
     
           
    
          
          
  
 
 
       
      
           
        
               
    
           
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. On October 12, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. On November 13, 2023, Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed. The case was assigned to me on May 3, 2024. The case was 
scheduled for hearing on September 12, 2024. It was continued and rescheduled for 
hearing on November 13, 2024. It was continued again for good cause and was finally 
scheduled and h eard on December 5, 2024. The hearing was held via video -
teleconference. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, which were 
marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 -7 and admitted without objection. Applicant 
testified and offered five exhibits, which were marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) A – E. The record was held open two weeks until December 12, 2024, to allow 
Applicant to submit additional documents. No additional documents were received. On 
December 16, 2024, DOHA received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. The record closed 
on that date. 
Some  details were   excluded  to  protect Applicant’s right to  privacy. Specific   
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.

Applicant has held several contractor positions in the national security area for 
over 20 years. He claims he ran into financial problems in 2016 when his then wife (now 
ex-wife) was injured at work. She had surgery and was unable to work for a few months. 
When she returned to work, she worked for 50% less pay in her new job. During this time, 
she decided to cash out one of her Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) which had a 
$10,000 balance to pay some bills. Applicant discovered that they owed the IRS $6, 000 
as a penalty for early withdrawal of the IRA. He decided to apply his 2017 federal income 
tax refund to the 2016 federal income tax debt. When he prepared his federal taxes for 
2017, he discovered he owed $4,000. He did not file his 2017 federal and st ate income 
tax returns because he did not know what to do about the taxes he owed. He eventually 
did not file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 
and 2022. (Tr. 29 – 39 ; GE 1 at 42; GE 2 at 14)  
Applicant was the sole-provider for a family of five living in an expensive area. He 
began to fall behind on his debts. He also admits he and his wife were over-extended on

credit cards. He did not know how to deal with his debt until someone mentioned an 
organization called NDR. He entered into an agreement with them on June 28, 2021, to 
help him resolve his debts. His divorce was final in 2022 and he will no longer be 
responsible for his wife’s expenses. He admits his issues with debt and taxes became 
more difficult to handle as they increased. He has taken steps to get help in paying off 
the debt. (GE 2 at 14, 18-37) 
On August 25, 2020, he began working with a tax service (HTS). He testified that 
they helped with filing his overdue income tax returns and paying fees and penalties. He 
claims the status of his federal taxes is that they are in review with the IRS. HTS is also 
working with him to file his state income tax returns as well. He has saved $18,500 to be 
able to pay any settlement the IRS offers. HTS has advised him that they anticipate he 
will have to pay the IRS about $25,000. If this is accurate, he will owe an additional $7,000 
to settle the federal tax debts. (Tr. 35 -39; GE 2 at 14, 38-49; GE 3 at 41) 
The current status of the delinquent debts are as follows:  
SOR ¶  1.a: Failure to  file Federal income  tax returns from  tax years 2017  to  tax  
years 2022: Applicant’s tax firm, HTS, provided  a  letter indicating  that they represent 
Applicant in his tax case. They  have  submitted  all  relevant information  to  the  IRS  and  are  
currently awaiting  their  response.  They  note  that Applicant has already made  payments 
totaling  $18,500  towards the  potential tax liability associated  with  the  case. No  proof was  
provided  that Applicant’s Federal income  tax returns were  filed  and  received  by the  IRS  
for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020,  2021,  and  2022. While  he  is working  on  his Federal  
tax issues, the tax issues remain outstanding. (AE B)  
 SOR ¶  1 .b: Failure  to  file sta te  income  tax returns for at  least  tax  years 2017,  
2018, 2019, 2020, 2021  and 2022: Applicant testified  that the  tax firm, HTS, will  be  filing  
his state  income  tax  returns as  well. He  believes that  he  does  not owe any money  towards  
his state  income  tax returns.  He did not provide  proof that his state  income  tax returns  
were filed for tax years 2017  –  2022. The state tax issues remain outstanding.

contribution  from  his wife’s income. The  divorce  was final in November 2022. As a  result,  
Applicant is now in a  better position  to  live  within his means. Ms. M.F. states  that while  
Applicant does not consider this an  excuse  for his financial situation,  this was his reality.  
She  hopes that his situation  be  considered  when  determining  his government security  
clearance  eligibility. (AE D)  
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National In telligence have established 
for issuing a clearance.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guideline s 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once  the  Government establishes a  disqualifying  condition  by substantial 
evidence, the  burden  shifts to  the  applicant  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or mitigate  the  
facts.  Directive ¶  E3.1.15.  An  applicant “has the  ultimate  burden  of demonstrating  that  it  
is clearly consistent with  the  national interest to  grant or continue  his security clearance.”  
ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at 3  (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The  burden  of disproving  a  
mitigating  condition  never shifts  to  the  Government.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  02-31154  at 5  
(App. Bd.  Sep. 22,  2005). “[S]ecurity clearance  determinations should err, if   they must,  
on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see  AG ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trus tworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sour ces of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following applies in this case: 
(a)  inability to satisfy debts: 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          
         
    
  
 
      
        
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          
         
(b)  a history of not meeting financial obligations: and   
(f)  failure to  file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local income  
tax returns or failure to  pay annual Federal,  state, or local income  tax as  
required.  
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(b) apply because Applicant incurred 23 delinquent debts, an 
approximate total balance of $38, 255. AG ¶ 19(f) applies because Applicant failed to 
timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019. 2020, 
2021, and 2022. 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising 
from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 
and the following apply: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur and  does not  cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   
(b) the  conditions  that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely  beyond  
the  person’s control   (e.g., loss   of employment,   business  downturn,  
unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death,  divorce  or separation, clear  
victimization  by predatory lending  practices, or identity  theft), and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(d) the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and   
(g) the  individual  has  made  arrangements  with  the  appropriate  tax  authority  
to  file  or pay  the  amount  owed  and  is in compliance  with  those  
arrangements.  
AG ¶  20(a) does not   apply because  many  of Applicant’s financial issues are   
ongoing  and remained  unresolved at the close of the record. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies  
because  it  appears Applicant’s divorce was a  condition  beyond  his control that  adversely  
affected  his finances.  This mitigating  condition  is given  less weight,  because  I cannot  
conclude  he  acted  responsibly under the  circumstances. Applicant incurred  a  lot of  
delinquent  debt before  his divorce  which  he  ignored  for years. His decision  to  not file his  
federal and state income  tax returns from  tax years 2017 to  2022  was not responsible.   
AG ¶ 20(d) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, 1.n, 1.t 
and 1.w because he paid them in full using NDR. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
           
           
       
 
     
       
      
          
        
            
 
 
     
     
      
       
           
      
         
        
      
      
        
         
         
  
 
    
           
     
  
 
 
 
1.m, 1.p, 1.q. 1.r. 1.s, and 1.u also apply because he is actively making payments towards 
these debts. He has been working with NDR to resolve all of his delinquent debts for 
several years now. He is making a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. 
AG ¶ 20(g) does not apply because there is insufficient documentation in the 
record which verifies that Applicant has filed all of federal and state tax returns for tax 
years 2017 to 2022. The record is also unclear how much Applicant will owe in past due 
federal income taxes and whether he will owe any for state income taxes. While Applicant 
is given credit for hiring HTS to help him sort out his tax situation, nothing was resolved 
at the close of the record. With regard to timely filing tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board 
has commented: 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14 -01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
While Applicant has made progress in resolving his financial issues, significant 
issues remain regarding his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns for over 
six years. It is too soon to conclude that Applicant met his burden of proof to mitigate the 
concerns raised under financial considerations. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative judge  must  evaluate  an  
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance  by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and  all  the  circumstances. The  administrative judge  should consider the  nine  
adjudicative process factors listed  at AG ¶  2(d):  
(1) the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           
        
       
       
  
 
     
        
      
         
            
        
      
           
            
                
         
      
  
         
         
     
  
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
    
 
   
     
     
   For Applicant  
      
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  
and  other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  for the  conduct;  
(8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  (9) the  
likelihood  of continuation or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole -person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. 
I considered Applicant’s over 20-year history as a contract employee for the U.S. 
government. I considered he has held a security clearance since 2001. I considered the 
favorable comments from his current supervisor, current and former co -workers and his 
close friend. I considered the letter from his therapist and the fact that he is still dealing 
with the adverse effects of his divorce. I also considered that he is a dedicated father. I 
considered that he has taken significant steps toward paying his delinquent debt through 
NDR. Despite these considerations, a concern remains because of Applicant’s failure to 
provide proof that he filed all of his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. While he began to take steps to resolve his 
federal and state tax problems in 2020 by hiring HTS, he still failed to file his federal and 
state income tax returns in 2021 and 2022. His lack of diligence in timely filing his federal 
and state income tax returns for over six y ears remains an issue. While Applicant put 
aside $18,500 to help pay any taxes owed, it is unclear that he will be able to resolve his 
tax debts. A promise to pay in the future, is not sufficient to mitigate security concerns 
raised by Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for over 
six years and his history of neglecting his delinquent accounts in the past. 
The security concerns raised under Financial Considerations are not mitigated.

_________________________ 
Conclusion  
In  light of all  of the  circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with  the  
interests of national security to  grant or continue  Applicant’s eligibility for a  security  
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
