Decision 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On September 2 9, 202 3, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and 
Security Agency, (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a statement 
of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960 ); DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 
1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix 
A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 
2017. 
The SOR detailed reasons why the D CSA CAS did not find under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be gr anted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline s F and E. On 
November 30, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge.

On May 3, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On August 13, 2024, DOHA issued 
a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October 10, 2024 . The hearing was held as 
scheduled using a video-teleconference system. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, Government Exhibits 
(GE) 1 - 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered ten exhibits which 
were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - J, without objection. The record was held 
open until October 24, 2024, to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He timely 
submitted three documents which were admitted as AE K (5 pages), AE L (6 pages), and 
AE M (11 pages), without objection. On October 25, 2024, DOHA received a transcript of 
the hearing. The record closed on that date. 
Some  details were   excluded  to  protect Applicant’s right to  privacy. Specific   
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admits the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.c and 
denies the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions are accepted as finding s of fact. 
Additional findings follow. 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee and sole owner of a defense contracting 
company seeking to maintain a security clearance. He has held a security clearance for 
over 34 years. He served in the Army National Guard between December 1989 to October 
2000. He has owned his own defense contracting business since 2002. His highest level 
of education is a Master in Business Administration (MBA). He recently received a Master 
in Biblical Studies and was ordained as a minister in his church. He has two adult 
daughters from his first marriage . He separated from his wife in 2018 . They divorced in 
2021. He is remarried. (Tr. 25; GE 1; GE 2 at 7; Response to SOR; AE A; AE B; AE F) 
Financial Considerations  
The SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent 
taxes in the approximate total amount of $544,595 for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 
and 2019. In August 2023, the Federal Government filed a tax li en against him in the 
amount of $10,690. The delinquent taxes remain unpaid (SOR ¶ 1.a: GE 2 at 29-31, 37, 
41-59; GE 3) Applicant is also alleged to owe delinquent taxes in the approximate amount 
of $107,600 to the state government where he resides for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 
2018, and 2019. In September 2016 and February 2018, the state placed tax liens against 
him in the respective amounts of $70,267 and $34, 537. The delinquent state tax debts 
remain unpaid. (SOR ¶ 1.b: GE 2 at 31, 60-113; GE 3 at 4, 6, 7) Finally, a judgment was 
entered against him in 2019 in the approximate amount of $92,242 related to second 
mortgage on a home that he and his first wife purchased. The judgment remains unpaid. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c: GE 2 at 8; GE 4; GE 5 at 2) 
Applicant’s contracting business had its ups and downs. In 2007, he had 30 
employees working for him. In 2008, there was a business downturn and there were only

three employees including Applicant. At present, he is the only employee of his company. 
He claims that the contracts slowed down, and it was difficult to keep up with obligations. 
In 2018, he got a job with another company for extra income. He continues to struggle to 
pay his debt obligations. (Tr. 24-26) 
As of September 2023, Applicant owed the IRS approximately $544,595 for 
delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. The primary 
cause of Applicant’s tax problems is that he failed to withhold sufficient income to pay the 
IRS for taxes owed. His IRS tax transcripts for the alleged tax years indicate the following: 
Tax Year 2014  –  Adjusted  Gross Income:  $836,664; Taxable Income: $755,207;  
Taxes Owed: $252,709; Amount Taxes Withheld:  $26,372; Balance  owed  as of  
September 11, 2023: $332,248.24. (GE 2 at 41-43)  
Tax Year 2015  –  Adjusted  Gross Income: $480,234; Taxable Income: $430 ,247; 
Taxes Owed:  $108,803; Amount Taxes Withheld:  $24,790; Balance  owed  as of  
September 11, 2023: $141,626.03. (GE 2 at 44-45)  
Tax Year 2016  –  Adjusted  Gross Income: $228,385; Taxable Income: $162,501; 
Taxes Owed:  $38,835; Amount  Taxes  Withheld:  $11,956; Balance  owed  as  of  September  
11, 2023: $43,946.75. (GE 2 at 46-47)  
Tax Year 2017 – Adjusted Gross Income: $ 96,800; Taxable Income: $ 38,584; 
Taxes Owed: $ 4,662; Amount Taxes Withheld: $ 3,998; tax payments were made on 
October 15, 2015, for $664 and December 3, 2018, for $36.83. The balance is zero. (GE 
2 at 48-49) 
Tax Year 2018  –  Adjusted  Gross Income: $213,686; Taxable Income: $184,027; 
Taxes Owed:  $32,745;  Amount  Taxes  Withheld:  $23,877; Balance  owed  as  of  September  
11, 2023: $13,129.28. (GE 2 at 50-51)  
Tax Year 2019  –  Adjusted  Gross Income: $173,079; Taxable Income: $160,879; 
Taxes Owed:  $33,561;  Amount  Taxes  Withheld:  $23,016; Balance  owed  as  of  September  
11, 2023: $13,646.17. (GE 2 at 52-53)  
Applicant began to use an accountant around 2003 to 2004 to assist with his taxes. 
The accountant advised him to pay his taxes upfront throughout the year . He did not 
follow his accountant’s advice. (Tr. 59, 64) 
Though not alleged in the SOR, Applicant owed taxes to the IRS for tax years 
2020, 2021, and 2022 because he failed to withhold sufficient taxes during each year. His 
current wife sold her home in 2023. Applicant was able to use approximately $ 93,000 
from the sale of the home towards paying the balances owed for tax years 2020, 2021, 
2022 and 2017 and 2019. He testified that he got an extension to file his federal income 
tax returns for tax year 2023. The return is filed. He earned $230,000 . He owes 
approximately $40,000. He failed to withhold enough income to pay his taxes. He intends

to take out a loan to pay off the tax debt. He indicates that in late 2023, he contracted with 
a company who assist him with preparing quarterly taxes. (Tr. 63-69; GE 2 at 40) 
Because Applicant’s federal tax debts for tax years 2020 – 2023 are not alleged in 
the SOR they will not be considered as matters of disqualification, but will be considered 
as matters of extenuation and mitigation . Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be 
considered to assess Applicant’s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative 
guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether Applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; 
or as part of a whole -person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03 -20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006) 
In June 2023, Applicant hired a tax firm to assist him with working out a payment 
plan with the IRS. He testified that he could afford to pay $2,000 a month towards his 
delinquent taxes. The IRS is conducting an investigation before they offer a payment plan. 
The possible payment plan is pending. (Tr. 60-61, 71-72; AE E; AE M at 11) 
State Tax Debt  
Applicant owes delinquent taxes to his state of residence in the approximate 
amount of $107, 600 for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. Specifically, he 
owes delinquent state income taxes for 2014: $70,00 0; 2015: $25,000; 2016: $6,000; 
2018: $4,500 and 2019: $2,500. (GE 2 at 31; 64-113)  
Applicant testified  that  he  made  $2,300  monthly payments towards  the  state  tax  
debt  from  2020  to  2023, with  the  exception  of  payments being  deferred  during  the  COVID-
19  pandemic.  He  made  various  payments to  the  state  to  apply towards his delinquent  tax  
debt between  July 2020  and  October 2020. (AE  L)  On  May 15,  2023, the  state  cancelled  
the  payment plan  for failure  to  make  the  agreed  upon  payments.  He  now makes a  monthly  
payment  of $542  a  month. He provided  proof of  payments for the  month  of December  
2023, February 2024,  and  April 2024.  (Tr. 72-75; GE 2  at 37)  
Applicant testified that he owes $23,000 in state taxes for tax year 2022. This was 
combined with the additional taxes owed to the state in the amount of $107,000 for a total 
of $130,000. (Tr. 74-75) The record is unclear as to the current balance of the delinquent 
state tax debt. The same tax lawyer who is helping arrange a payment plan for the federal 
tax debt is arranging a payment plan regarding his delinquent state tax debt. (Tr. 77) 
SOR ¶ 1c: $92,242  Judgement  –  Delinquent Second Mortgage  
In 2014, Applicant and his first wife purchased a home for $690,000. The bank 
required them to borrow one mortgage in the amount of $500,000 as a 30 -year fixed 
mortgage and second mortgage in the amount of $104,000 as a line of credit. (Tr. 27) 
During an October 2020 interview with an investigator conducting his background 
investigation, Applicant indicated he stopped making payments in in November 2018 to 
May 2019, because he could not afford to pay the mortgage whi le paying rent. He told

the investigator that he requested a loan modification, but his request was denied. He 
arranged to make $400 monthly payments in April 2020. (GE 2 at 8) 
When he separated from his wife in 2018, he agreed to pay the larger mortgage 
and he claims his wife agreed to pay the second mortgage. His wife did not make the 
payments on the second mortgage. The loan became delinquent. The bank offered to 
settle the amount for $25,000. Applicant could not afford to make the payments at the 
time of the offer. He did pay the original creditor $400 in October 2020, November 2020, 
March 2020, and March 2021. (Tr. 27-28; AE M at 10) 
At present, a law firm specializing in debt collection purchased the debt. The law 
firm offered to settle the debt for $100,000. In October 2023, Applicant sent a letter to the 
law firm with a counteroffer to pay the debt for $5,000 . The law firm did not accept this 
offer. He is still attempting to negotiate a settlement for this debt. (Tr. 54-56; AE H; AE J; 
AE I) 
During the period of time that Applicant has encountered significant delinquent 
federal and state ta x debt, he has traveled abroad on numerous occasions every year. 
One of his daughters lives in Europe and he has family in Haiti and Canada. Some of 
these trips were made to visit family members and some were vacations. In 2023, 
Applicant and his current wife purchased a house , using some of the proceeds from the 
sale of her home and his Veterans Affairs (VA) loan. The purchase price was $1.1 million. 
(Tr. 64-66,70; GE 1 at 39-63, 72; GE 2 at 11-12, 15) 
Personal Conduct  
 Under the  Personal Conduct Concern, Applicant is alleged  to  have  deliberately  
falsified  material  facts  on  his January 23,  2018,  e-QIP  application  in  response  Section  26-
Financial Record Taxes.  “In  the  last  seven  (7) years have  you  failed  to  file or pay Federal, 
state,  or other taxes when  required  by law or ordinance ?” when  he  answered, “No”. He  
deliberately failed  to  list his delinquent taxes owed  for Federal income  taxes for tax years  
2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and  2019  and  his delinquent taxes owed  for state  income  taxes  
for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. (SOR ¶ 2.a: GE  1  at 69)  
Applicant contends that he did not deliberately omit his delinquent federal and state 
income tax debts on his 2018 e-QIP. He states he answered, “no” because he filed his 
federal and state income tax returns. He believed there was no place to add additional 
information about his delinquent tax debts. He said the question was confusing. When 
the investigators interviewed him during his background investigation interview , he was 
truthful about his delinquent debts and cooperated with them throughout the process. (Tr. 
24-26) 
Under cross examination, Applicant admits that not listing that he owed over 
$600,000 to the federal and state government for delinquent taxes was a false answer. 
He said that he felt he could no t make comments that would add con text to answering 
“yes” to the question. Department Counsel addressed his attention to page 72 o n his

January 2018 e -QIP application. The last section was titled “Additional Comments.” It 
read: 
Use space below to  continue  answers to all  other items  and to provide any  
information  you  would  like  to  add. Before each  answer, identify the  number  
on the item.   
 
Applicant  wrote:  
 
I have done  more foreign travel that what is listed  but I  don’t have  my older  
passport to  list those  dates. Generally, I travel to  Haiti and  Europe  for  
pleasure. I also have  traveled  to  Canada  the  last  couple of years for  
pleasure as well.  
Applicant responded that he believed the Additional Comments were related to his 
travel. He claims it was not intuitive for him to add additional information about his 
delinquent tax debts. (Tr. 78-80; GE 1 at 72) 
Character Evidence  
Mr. C, Applicant’s friend and former neighbor testified on his behalf. He has PhD 
in mechanical engineering and has done work for the U.S. Navy. He held a security 
clearance for about 10 years. He is currently on sabbatical due to health reasons. They 
met around 2002-2003 when they both were building homes in the same development. 
They became good friends. He served as Applicant’s best man in his second wedding. 
He describes Applicant as reliable and trustworthy. He borrowed $5,000 from him during 
a period where he was having financial issues. Applicant paid him back after a couple 
years. Applicant is reliable and trustworthy. (Tr. 36-43) 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent wit h the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge ’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An

administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant ’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National In telligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guideline s 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant ’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01 -20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: 
Failure to  live  within  one's means, satisfy debts, and  meet financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual's reliability, trustworthiness,  and  ability to  
protect  classified  or  sensitive information.  Financial distress can  also be  
7 
 
 
                                         
 
 
     
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
    
 
 
        
           
         
        
         
  
 
        
            
       
           
   
 
      
        
  
 
 
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of,  other  
issues of  personnel security  concern  such  as  excessive gambling, mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol  abuse  or dependence. An  
individual who  is financially overextended  is at greater risk of having  to  
engage  in  illegal  or  otherwise questionable acts  to  generate  funds.  
Affluence  that cannot be  explained  by known  sources of income  is  also a  
security concern insofar as it may result from  criminal activity, including  
espionage.  
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of them under AG ¶ 19 and the following apply: 
(a)   inability to satisfy  debts;  
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;   
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
Applicant failed to pay his federal and state income taxes for tax years 2014, 2015, 
2016, 2018, and 2019. He owes the IRS approximately $544,595 in delinquent taxes. He 
owes over $130,000 in delinquent taxes to his state. AG ¶ 19(f) applies. His tax problems 
were an issue of his own making. He had the income, but chose to not withhold sufficient 
income to apply towards his taxes each year, which created the tax debt. AG ¶ 19( b) 
applies. 
Applicant owes a $92,242 judgment related to a second mortgage . While he 
blames his ex -wife for not making the monthly payments, he was obligated to pay the 
mortgage company if his wife was unable to make payments. Private businesses are not 
parties to a couple’s property settlement agreements in a divorce. AG ¶ 19(a) and AG ¶ 
19(c) apply. 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising 
from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 
and the following potentially apply: 
AG ¶  20(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent, or  
occurred  under such  circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur and does not 
cast doubt on  the  individual’s current reliability , trustworthiness, or  good  
judgment;    
AG ¶  20(b) the  conditions that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely 
beyond  the  person's control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business  
downturn, unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death, divorce  or separation,  
8 
 
 
                                         
 
 
 
 
 
       
      
      
        
     
          
       
         
       
         
         
    
 
         
        
                
             
            
        
     
 
        
      
      
            
    
   
        
       
           
       
  
clear victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices, or identity  theft),  and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
AG ¶  20(c)  the  individual has  received  or is receiving  financial counseling  
for the  problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source, such  as a  non-profit 
credit counseling  service, and  there  are clear indications  that the  problem 
is being resolved or under control;   
AG ¶  20(d)  the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve  debts; and   
AG ¶  20(g) the  individual has  made  arrangements with  the  appropriate  tax 
authority to  file or pay  the  amount owed  and  is in  compliance  with  those  
arrangements.  
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply becau se 
Applicant’s issues with delinquent state and federal tax debts and his delinquent second 
mortgage debt are ongoing. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies because Applicant’s separation 
and divorce was a circumstance beyond his control. However, it is given less weight 
because I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. He 
neglected to timely pay his federal and state income taxes for more th ree years before 
his marital separation. He failed to withhold sufficient funds to pay his federal and state 
income taxes for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. As a result, he incurred a 
$544,595 delinquent federal tax debt and delinquent state taxes of over $104,000. Rather 
than dealing with the issue as soon as it was discovered, he continues to withhold 
insufficient funds to pay his federal and state income taxes even though his accountant 
advised him to do this years ago. 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply because Applicant ignored attempts to resolve and pay 
his federal and state income tax debts for years. While he made some occasional 
payments, he did not hire a tax attorney until June 2023 and did not have a payment plan 
in place as of the close of the record. It is too soon to conclude he will be capable of 
meeting the terms of his payment plans. He has also not resolved the debt owed towards 
the second mortgage. His counter-offer of $5,000 to settle a $100,000 debt is not a good-
faith effort to resolve the debt. 
AG ¶ 20(g) does not apply. While Applicant is the process of making payment 
arrangements to resolve his federal and state tax debts, no payment arrangements are 
in effect. He ignored his tax problems for years which further aggravated his tax situation. 
He also ignored resolving the second mortgage debt. Given his past record, it is too soon 
to conclude he will follow through on his payment agreements. 
Applicant receives some credit for filing his federal and state tax returns, however, 
any credit is minimized by his extended delay in paying his delinquent taxes. The DOHA 
Appeal Board has held that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has 
a problem with abiding by well -established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, 
9 
 
 
                                         
 
              
      
       
         
 
 
       
           
           
        
           
   
  
 
   
 
         
  
  
 
        
           
             
       
          
          
    
 
        
  
 
        
    
e.g., ISCR Case No. 16 -01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes 
when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required 
of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 
4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). 
In this case, Applicant ’s attempt to resolve his federal and state tax issues, after 
years of ignoring the tax debts, occurred too late. So too, his failure to resolve his second 
mortgage debt occurred too late. It is noted that during the years Applicant incurred these 
debts, he traveled extensively out of the country to Europe, Haiti, and Canada. He and 
his current wife purchased a new home for $1.1 million in 2023. He is not taking his tax 
issues seriously. The security concerns raised under Financial Considerations are not 
mitigated. 
Guideline  E, Personal Conduct  
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
Conduct involving  questionable judgment, lack of candor,  dishonesty,  or  
unwillingness to  comply with  rules and  regulations can  raise  questions  
about an  individual's  reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to  protect  
classified  or sensitive  information.  Of  special  interest is any  failure to  
cooperate  or provide  truthful and  candid answers during  national  security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: 
(a) deliberate  omission, concealment,  or falsification  of relevant facts from  
any personnel  security questionnaire, personal history statement,  or similar  
form  used  to  conduct investigations,  determine  employment qualifications,  
award  benefits or status,  determine  security clearance  eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;   
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent federal and state tax debts 
on his January 2018 e -QIP application in response to “Section 26 – Financial Record 
Taxes – In the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other 
taxes when required by law or ordinance?” He claims that he was confused about the 
question because it required a two -part answer. I do not find his ex planations credible. 
He has held a security clearance for over 34 years. He is a highly educated m an who 
owns his own defense contracting business. AG ¶ 16(a) applies. 
AG ¶ 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant’s case: 
(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and 
10 
 
 
                                         
 
    
       
     
 
 
       
      
        
          
     
          
     
   
 
 
 
        
 
       
   
 
         
      
      
        
      
     
   
   
 
           
        
        
       
    
 
    
            
          
           
   
 
      
             
    
       
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual ’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
Neither mitigating condition applies. There is no evidence that Applicant made a 
prompt good-faith effort to correct the omission of his delinquent federal tax debts before 
being confronted with the facts. AG ¶ 17(c) does not apply to Applicant’s intentional 
omissions of his federal and state income tax debts in response to Section 26 on his 
January 2018 secu rity clearance application. Falsification of a security clearance 
application is not “minor” because it “strikes at the heart of the security clearance 
process.” ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). Applicant’s behavior raises 
serious concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Personal 
conduct security concerns are not mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole -person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coe rcion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. M y comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole -person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant did not proactively begin to resolve his delinquent s tate and federal 
income tax issues for years. In June 2023, he hired a tax firm to assist with a payment 
plan with the IRS for his federal tax debts and with the state department of revenue for 
his state tax debts. At the close of the record, no formal repayment agreement was agreed 
upon by either the IRS or the state tax authorities. 
The Appeal Board ’s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. 
Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of a security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking 
action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security

clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated ”). 
See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a 
security clearance and stating “A security clearance represents an obligation to the 
Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly , failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant ’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”). 
In addition to the delinquent tax debts, the second mortgage debt also remain ed 
unresolved at the close of the record. He also deliberately omitted the fact that he owed 
over $544,595 delinquent federal tax debts for tax years 2014 -2016 and 2018-2019 and 
over $107,000 in delinquent state income taxes for the same tax years on his January 
2018 security clearance application. His failure to disclose his delinquent tax debts on his 
security clearance application raises questions about his trustworthiness and reliability. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Security concerns under Financial Considerations and 
Personal Conduct are not mitigated. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:  AGAINST  APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs  1.a  –  1.c Against  Applicant  
Paragraph  2, Guideline  E AGAINST  APPLICANT   
Subparagraph  2.a:  Against Applicant  
Conclusion  
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
