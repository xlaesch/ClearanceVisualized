2024. On December 2, 2024 , a fter coordination with counsel, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing via 
video teleconference. I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 11, 2025. 
Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit s (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant 
testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. During the hearing, Department 
Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 3.f, which I granted without 
objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 97-101; Hearing Exhibit (HE) I-II) The record was held open 
until March 3, 2025, to permit Applicant to respond to the SOR amendments and to submit 
additional documentary evidence. (HE I; Tr. 113-114) He timely responded to the SOR 
amendments and submitted AE D through G. (HE I-IV) GE 1 through 6 and AE A through 
G were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on February 24, 
2025. The record closed on March 3, 2025. 
Findings of Fact  
In his response to the SOR as amended, Applicant admitted all allegations with 
explanations. (Answer; HE I-IV) His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. 
Applicant is 33-years old. He has earned several information technology (IT) 
certificates and anticipates earning a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity and information 
assurance in August 2025. He is unmarried and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 28-30, 92-93) 
 Applicant has worked  overseas for various defense  contractors  since  August 2012.  
He has been  employed  by a defense  contractor  (Company1)  since  October 2023. He was  
hired  to  work  a  service  desk in  Country A  and  was  promoted  to  computer  system  
administrator.  He was employed  by a  different  defense  contractor  (Company2),  as service  
desk lead  in Country B  from  January 2018  to  June  2021  and  in Country C from  July to  
August 2022. He  worked  as a mail  handler/clerk  for  another defense  contractor

Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct  
Under Guideline H , t he SOR alleges Applicant purchased anabolic steroids in 
about September 2020, used anabolic steroids two times a week from January to May 
2021, and shipped anabolic steroids to himself in Country C in July 2022, SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.c. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges he was fired from his employment in about 
August 2022 for shipping anabolic steroids to himself in Country C, SOR ¶ 2.a . He 
admitted each allegation with explanation. He purchased anabolic steroids due to weight 
issues after a surgical weight loss procedure and had them shipped overseas. He denied 
using anabolic steroids twice per week but admitted occasionally using them from 
January to May 2021. He claimed that after the steroids were discovered he was open

and honest about his purchase and drug use, and that he did not hide anything from his 
employer or during a background interview. (SOR Response; HE III-IV; Tr. 30-31) 
Applicant has been interested in weightlifting and bodybuilding since high school. 
He was also interested in trying steroids but was aware possession and use of anabolic 
steroids in the U.S., without a prescription, was prohibited by law. While working in 
Country D from 2015 to January 2018, he lost a significant amount of weight through diet, 
exercise, and advice received from an Army Specialist (friend) he met in 2016. In about 
2017, the friend suggested he use steroids, but he did not. After moving to Country B, he 
followed his friend’s advice on how to build strength and muscle mass . In 2019, he had 
gastric sleeve surgery and lost about 100 pounds. In the fall of 2020, he contacted his 
friend and asked if he should use steroids to build muscle mass. His friend said it would 
be a good idea , advised him which substances to use, how to order them over the 
Internet, and how to use them. (GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 17-19, 42) 
In September 2020, Applicant ordered about eight vials of anabolic steroids from 
a company in Country E for about $1,100. He had the steroids mailed to a military facility 
in Country B where he was working for Company2. He purchased enough steroids for 
multiple 12-week injection cycles. He first used the steroids in September or October 
2020, and then injected the steroids about twice a week from January to May 2021 , 
usually on “Monday and a Thursday.” (GE 1 at 38-39; Tr. 33, 91) In June 2021, he shipped 
the remaining viles of steroids to the United States. (GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 31-40) 
In July 2022, he was rehired by Company2 to work in Country C. He mailed the 
vials of steroids from the U.S. to Country C with the intent to use them there. On August 
8, 2022, the steroids were discovered during an inspection at a military mail facility. During 
an interview with Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) investigators, Appellant 
was cooperative, admitted shipping the steroids to himself, and identified his Army 
Specialist friend as the person who advised him how to obtain and to use the steroids. A 
CID military justice advisor concluded “there was probable cause to believe [Applicant] 
committed the offense of U se the Mail with Intent to Carry on an Unlawful Activity” in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952. (GE 5 at 2) On August 15, 2022 , Company2 terminated 
his employment because he shipped steroids to Country B. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 4-5; Tr. 33) 
In his August 2022 SCA, Applicant reported he had been fired in August 2022, 
because: 
I mailed  myself steroids not knowing  they were illegal in  [Country C]. They  
were  confiscated  by CID.  I met with  CID and  was completely  honest with  
them  and  told them  I made  an  honest mistake  and  didn’t realize  it was  illegal 
until arriving  in  [Country C]  ….  I  used  steroids while I  was deployed  in  
[Country B] and have never used  it since  . . .  [He  estimated  the month  and  
year of his first  and  most recent  uses  as  September 2020  and  estimated  the  
number of times used  as] a  twelve week cycle.   
(GE 1 at 13-15, 38-39) 
On January 23, 2023, Applicant told a government background investigator the 
following. From January to May 2021, he injected steroids each Monday and Wednesday

while working in Country C. In June 2021 he shipped the remaining steroids to the United 
States. In July 2022, he mailed the steroids through the U.S. mail system to Country C. 
He acknowledged knowing that introducing steroids into the U.S. mail system was not 
legal but said his friend claimed to ship steroids through the mail without problems. He 
understood that overseas U.S. military installations were bound by U.S. law but did not 
think such laws would be enforced in a forward deployed area. Based on what his friend 
told him, he felt the use of steroids by deployed soldiers and contractors overseas was 
unofficially sanctioned by authorities by not enforcing the rules. He has learned there is 
no amnesty or immunity fr om U.S. laws while serving as a contractor on an overseas 
military installation . He will not engage in future substance misuse because he has 
learned his lesson and understands he could be fired or charged criminally. (GE 2 at 4-5; 
Tr. 28-29, 94-95) 
Applicant initially testified he was unaware that the use of steroids was illegal in 
Country C and “didn't realize the severity of it until [they were discovered in July 2022].” 
(Tr. 36) After being questioned about his more than four years’ experience as a mail clerk 
in overseas military post offices and when asked why his claims that he did not know it 
was unlawful to send steroids to overseas military post offices should be believed he 
responded, “As far as [Country B], me ordering them from another country to [Country B]. 
I didn't know. As far as me mailing them to [Country C], I knew I could possibly get in 
trouble if this (sic) were to get confiscated.” (Tr. 88) After being informed his testimony 
seemed inconsistent with his mail clerk experience, he responded, “I knew what I was 
doing was wrong.” (Tr. 86-91) 
Applicant testified the only person he knew on base who used steroids and who 
knew how to order them was his friend. He did not disclose his steroid purchase , 
possession or use to others and explained he typically did not tell coworkers about his 
online purchases and “[i]t’s something [he] chose not to share. ” (Tr. 36) He received 
comments on his muscle gain but “didn’t share [the steroid] part.” (Tr. 31-42) 
Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct  
Under Guideline F, t he SOR alleges Applicant ha s approximately $ 37,744 in 
delinquent debt including a mortgage charged off for $24,083, and he failed to timely file 
federal and state income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2021 and TY 2022, (SOR ¶ 3.a-3.f). 
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges he falsified material facts in his August 2022 SCA by 
deliberately failing to disclose he failed to timely file and pay his TY 2021 Fed eral and 
state taxes, SOR ¶ 2.b. He admitted each allegation. (Answer; HE II-IV) 
Applicant invested about $50,000 in his trucking business, incurred at least 
$30,000 in loans to finance it, and received about $27,000 when he sold off the assets. 
He attributes his financial problems to failure of his trucking business, providing proceeds 
from the sale of some assets to his former fiancée who helped him finance the business, 
unemployment, and underemployment after being fired in August 2022 , and to 
contributions of about $600 monthly to help pay for his sister’s medication. He planned to 
pay his debts with income from the lucrative job in Country C. (Tr. 19-30, 42-44, 70-75) 
SOR ¶ 3.a: credit account placed for collection of $4,862. Applicant admitted 
the allegation, said he entered a payment agreement and that the balance was $4,284.

(Answer) Credit reports from October 2023 and February 2025 show the account was 
placed for collection, and with a past due balance of $4,862 and $1,994, respectively. He 
submitted evidence of monthly payments under a payment plan from December 2023 to 
November 2025, that reduced the past due balance to $1,994 as of February 2025. (GE 
3 at 3, GE 6 at 1; AE A at 8, 16-18; Tr. 19-26, 46-48, 77-78) This debt is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 3.b: loan account charged off for $ 24,083. Applicant admitted he was 
delinquent on the loan, stated the balance was $23,083, and estimated he would pay the 
debt off by November 2025 . (Answer; AE A at 8 ) Credit reports from October 2023 and 
February 2025 show the loan was opened in June 2021 , charged off for $24,083, and 
with a past due balance of $ 13,967 and $ 22,483, respectively. Applicant testified he 
entered an agreement to pay the creditor $300 per month in January 2024 , that he 
sometimes made extra payments, and that his payments reduced the past due balance 
to less than $20,000 . He submitted documentary evidence of payments on January 15 
and February 4, 2025, and scheduled payments on February 18 and March 3, 2025, but 
did not provide evidence of payment amounts or account balance. (Answer; GE 3 at 4, 
GE 6 at 1; AE A at 8, AE C; Tr. 19-26, 49-50, 78-80) 
SOR ¶ 3.c: credit card charged off for $1,762. Applicant admitted the allegation 
and said the balance was $1,084. (Answer) Credit reports from October 2023 and 
February 2025 show the account was charged off with a past due balance of $1,762 and 
$679, respectively. Applicant submitted documentary evidence of monthly payments from 
November 2023 to July 2024 and paid the debt in full in February 2025. (GE 3 at 5, GE 6 
at 1; AE A at 8, AE D, AE G; Tr. 48-49, 78-79) This debt is resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 3.d-3.e: credit cards from same creditor charged off for $2,444 and 
$4,593, respectively. Applicant admitted the allegation and said the combined balance 
of the two debts was $2,350. (Answer) Credit reports show the account s were charged 
off for $2,444 and $4,593, respectively, with past due balances of $1,420 and $2,953 in 
October 2023 , and settled for less than the full balance on or before February 2025 . 
Applicant testified the debts were paid and submitted documentary evidence of monthly 
payments on the debts from November 2023 to July 2024. (GE 3 at 6, GE 6 at 2; AE A at 
8, 12-15; Tr. 26, 45-46) These debts are resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 3:f and 2:b: failure to file, as required, Federal and state income tax 
returns for tax year (TY) 2021 and TY 2022, and falsified material facts on an August 
2022 SCA by denying he failed to timely file or pay federal and state income taxes 
in the past seven years and deliberately failing to disclose he failed to file and pay 
federal and state taxes for TY 2021. Applicant admitted he did not timely file income tax 
returns for TY 2021 and TY 2022 and that he falsified material facts on his August 2022 
SCA by denying he failed to timely file or pay federal and state income taxes . (Answer; 
HE III-IV; Tr. 58-59, 74) He said he was overwhelmed with his trucking business, did not 
timely file the delinquent tax returns because he could not afford to pay taxes due, and 
planned to file and pay them after starting a lucrative job in Country C. He said he filed 
TY 2021 and TY 2022 state and federal income tax returns in November 2023 with the 
assistance of a certified public accountant (CPA); he owed a little more than $50,000 for 
state and federal taxes; he entered payment plans with the IRS and state tax authorities 
in January 2024, and that he had made required monthly payments of $1,400 or $700 to

each tax authority. He said another CPA assisted him in filing income tax returns for TY 
2017 through TY 2020 and TY 2023. He provided no explanation for falsifying material 
facts on his August 2022 SCA or for deliberately failing to disclose his failure to timely file 
and pay federal and state taxes for TY 2021. (Answer; HE I-IV; GE 1 at 42; AE A at 11, 
AE F; Tr. 52-60, 68-77, 95-96) 
Applicant submitted documentary evidence of an IRS installment agreement for 
TY 2017 through TY 2021 with taxes, interest and penalties totaling $50,247 , as of 
February 1, 2024, and that he made required monthly payments of $658 from April 2024 
to January 2025 . He did not submit documentary evidence regarding overdue state 
income tax returns or taxes for TY 2021 and TY 2022. (HE I-IV; GE 1; AE A at 11, AE F; 
Tr. 52-60, 68-77, 95-96) His federal income tax problems are being resolved but there is 
no evidence he has resolved or is resolving his delinquent state income tax issues. 
Applicant said he currently has about $2,000 remaining after paying his monthly 
expenses, that he has about $5,000 in the ba nk, does not have retirement savings or 
other investments, and that he does not own a home or vehicle . He submitted evidence 
of payments from October 2024 to February 2025 on a debt not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 
53-55, 93; AE B, AE E) 
During the hearing Applicant was informed of the importance of providing 
documentary evidence regarding matters alleged in the SOR , including debt payments, 
contact with creditors, efforts to address or resolve his delinquent debts , IRS records 
including his tax account transcript, and his current financial circumstances. (Tr. 6-7, 49, 
65-70, 113-114) 
Character Statements  
Applicant submitted evidence from Company1 officials that showed he had been 
hired and promoted because of his accomplishments, workplace professionalism , 
technical skills, and his dedication to mission. (AE B at 1-7). He also submitted character 
letters from his program manager and site lead at Company1, a former coworker and 
supervisor, a senior master sergeant in the Air National Guard and friend, and a long-
term family friend that commented favorably on his character and work performance. (AE 
A at 20-27, AE B) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is responsible, 
technically skilled, professional, communicative, trustworthy, reliable, follows instructions, 
dedicated to his work and family, a good teammate and leader, and that he should be 
granted eligibility for access to classified information. 
Policies  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

 Eligibility for a  security clearance  is predicated  upon  the  applicant meeting  the  
criteria  contained  in the  adjudicative guidelines (AG). These  guidelines are not inflexible  
rules of  law. Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities of human  behavior, these  guidelines  
are applied  in conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of the  whole person. An  administrative  
judge’s overarching  adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An  
administrative judge  must consider all  available,  reliable information  about the  person,  
past and present,  favorable and  unfavorable.  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
      
 
     
 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
“The  applicant is responsible  for presenting  witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  
explain, extenuate, or mitigate  facts admitted  by the  applicant or proven  by Department 
Counsel,  and  has the  ultimate  burden  of persuasion  as to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance  
decision.”  Directive ¶  E3.1.15.  An  applicant  “has the  ultimate  burden  of  demonstrating  
that it  is clearly consistent with  the  national  interest  to  grant or continue  his security  
clearance.” ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at 3  (App. Bd. Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance  
determinations should err, if they must,  on  the  side  of denials.” Department of the  Navy  
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see  AG ¶  2(b).  
The  protection  of the  national security is the  paramount consideration. Under AG  
¶  2(b), any doubt “will be  resolved  in favor of the  national security.” Section  7  of EO 10865  
provides that decisions  shall  be  “in  terms of the  national interest and  shall  in no  sense  be  
a  determination  as to  the  loyalty of the  applicant concerned.” See  also  EO  12968, Section  
3.1(b) (listing  multiple  prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
Analysis  
Guideline H,  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse  
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 24: 
The  illegal use  of controlled  substances,  to  include  the  misuse  of  
prescription  and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances 
that  cause  physical or mental impairment  or are  used  in a  manner  
inconsistent with  their  intended  purpose  can  raise  questions about an  
individual's reliability and  trustworthiness, both  because  such  behavior may  
lead  to  physical or psychological impairment and  because  it raises  
questions about  a  person's ability or  willingness to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  
and  regulations. Controlled  substance  means  any "controlled  substance"  as  
defined  in 21  U.S.C. 802. Substance  misuse  is the  generic term  adopted  in  
this guideline  to  describe any of the behaviors listed above.  
The following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 25 are potentially applicable: 
(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); 
7 
 
 
 
        
  
 
        
    
   
          
            
    
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         
     
    
  
 
      
         
          
           
     
      
          
  
 
           
        
      
         
     
(c)  illegal possession  of a  controlled  substance, including  cultivation,  
processing,  manufacture, purchase, sale,  or distribution; or possession  of  
drug paraphernalia; and    
(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or 
holding a sensitive position. 
AG ¶¶ 25(a) , 25(c), and 25(f) are established. Record evidence including a CID 
report and Applicant’s admissions show he ordered anabolic steroids in September 2020, 
first used steroids in September or October 2020, regularly injected them for twelve weeks 
from January 2021 to May 2021, shipped the remaining steroids to the United States in 
about June 2021 , and possessed steroids until mailing them to Country C in July 2022 
where he intended to use them. 
The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 26 are potentially applicable: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or happened  
under such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur or does  not cast  doubt  
on  the  individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good  judgment;  and   
(b) the  individual acknowledges his or her drug  involvement and  substance  
misuse,  provides evidence  of actions taken  to  overcome  this problem, and  
has established  a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited  to:  
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;   
(2) changing  or avoiding  the  environment  where drugs  were  used; 
and  
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug 
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future 
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security 
eligibility. 
AG ¶¶ 26(a) and AG ¶ 26(b) are not fully established. Applicant’s claims he last 
used steroids in May 2021 and last possessed them in July 2022 are supported by the 
evidence. Although his claims that he intends to abstain from substance misuse because 
his past substance misuse has had such a significant impact on his employment and 
finances seem plausible, I did not find his claims that he did not know steroids were illegal 
in Country C credible. His actions and hearing testimony were unconvincing and 
inconsistent with someone who was reliably telling the truth on this matter for the reasons 
discussed below. 
In his August 2022 SCA and at hearing he claimed he did not know steroids were 
illegal in Country C, and told a CID investigator he did not think possession and use of 
steroids overseas was an issue. In his January 2023 background interview, he 
acknowledged knowing it was illegal to introduce steroids into the U.S. mail system and 
that overseas U.S. military installations were bound by U.S. law, but did not think such 
8 
 
 
 
       
       
          
         
           
    
 
     
       
           
  
 
 
   
 
 
     
        
     
      
      
   
 
         
     
        
     
laws would  be  enforced  in  forward deployed  areas  based  on  what he  was told by his  
friend.  He  later testified  “[a]s far as me  mailing  [steroids]  to  [Country C],  I knew I could  
possibly get in  trouble  if [they]  were  to  get confiscated.” (Tr. 88) After being   asked  to  
reconcile  his claims  of ignorance  with  his extensive  experience  working  in  overseas  
military post offices   he  responded,  “I knew what I   was doing  was  wrong.”  (Tr. 88-89)  
Notably, his friend  was the  only person  he  knew on  base  who  used  steroids and  knew  
how to  order  them, and  he  did  not discuss  his  purchase,  possession  or  use  of  steroids  
with others.  
Applicant also provided varying accounts of his steroid use. In his September 2022 
SCA he reported first and most recently us ing steroids for a twelve-week cycle in about 
September 2020 and claimed he had not used t hem since. He told a background 
investigator and testified at hearing that he injected steroids two times a week from 
January to May 2021. And in his January 2024 response to the SOR he admitted using 
steroids occasionally from January to May 2021, but denied using them twice a week. 
His behavior and lack of candor cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment. He has not submitted the statement of intent provided for 
in AG ¶ 26(b)(3), and when considered along with concerns discussed above, I find the 
evidence insufficient to fully establish the mitigating conditions. 
Guideline F,  Financial Considerations  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to   live  within  one’s means, satisfy debts,  and  meet  financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to   
protect  classified  or  sensitive information.  Financial distress can  also be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of,  other  
issues of personnel security concern  such  as  excessive gambling  mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol abuse  or dependence. An  
individual who  is financially overextended  is at greater risk of having  to  
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to  generate funds.  . . .   
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about a person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or 
sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
The record evidence, including credit reports and Applicant’s admissions, establish 
three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”), 
AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file 
. . . annual Federal, state … income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state ... 
9 
 
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
          
          
 
 
        
        
          
        
         
            
          
         
       
      
  
 
         
   
 
   
             
         
          
           
        
     
 
income tax as required”). The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur and  does not  cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   
(b) the  conditions  that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely  beyond  
the  person’s  control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business downturn,  
unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death,  divorce  or separation, clear  
victimization  by predatory lending  practices, or identity  theft), and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has received  or is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as  a  non-profit  credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is being  
resolved  or is under control;  
(d) the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a 
through 3.e because Applicant has provided documentary evidence he resolved or is 
resolving the debts. The failure of his trucking business precipitated his nontax related 
financial problems and was largely beyond h is control. Although the timing and lack of 
evidence regarding payments on the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3(b) raise some question as 
to whether he acted in good faith with respect to th at debt, there is no requirement that 
an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously. See ISCR Case No. 
07-06482 at 2 -3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). I find that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a 
through 3.e occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, that Applicant has acted 
responsibly under the circumstances and that these debts do not cast doubt on his 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply because there is no evidence Applicant has sought or 
received financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source. 
AG ¶ 20(g) is established for his failure to timely file federal income tax returns for 
TY 2021 and TY 2022 because his testimony that he filed the delinquent tax returns in 
November 2023 is corroborated, in part, by evidence he signed an installment agreement 
with the IRS in December 2023 and has complied with that agreement. AG ¶ 20(g) is not 
established for his failure to file, as required, state income tax returns for TY 2021 and TY 
2022 because he submitted no documentary evidence the delinquent income tax returns 
have been filed or that he paid or has made arrangements to pay delinquent state taxes.

Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
Conduct involving  questionable judgment, lack of candor,  dishonesty,  or  
unwillingness to  comply with  rules and  regulations can  raise  questions  
about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to  protect  
classified  or sensitive  information.  Of  special interest is any  failure to  
cooperate  or provide  truthful and  candid answers during  national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
The following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 16 are potentially applicable: 
(a)  deliberate  omission, concealment,  or falsification  of relevant facts from  
any personnel  security questionnaire, personal history statement,  or similar  
form  used  to  conduct investigations,  determine  employment qualifications,  
award  benefits or status, determine  national security eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
(d) credible  adverse information  that is not  explicitly covered  under any  
other guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient by itself for an  adverse  
determination, but which, when  combined  with  all  available  information,  
supports a  whole-person  assessment of questionable judgment,  
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to  comply with  
rules and  regulations, or other characteristics  indicating  that the  individual  
may not  properly safeguard classified  or sensitive  information. This  
includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include  breach of client  
confidentiality,  release  of proprietary information, unauthorized  
release  of  sensitive corporate or government protected information;  
(2) any disruptive, violent,  or other inappropriate  behavior;   
(3)  a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and  
(4)  evidence  of  significant  misuse  of  Government  or other employer's  
time  or resources;  and  
(e) personal conduct,  or concealment of  information  about  one's conduct,  
that creates a  vulnerability to  exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a  
foreign  intelligence  entity or  other  individual or group.  Such  conduct  
includes:  
(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing; 
11 
 
 
 
  
   
 
         
       
          
           
        
     
 
      
 
 
 
      
  
 
          
         
     
     
 
          
        
         
      
          
         
         
         
     
 
         
       
         
       
   
 
 
(2) while in another country, engaging  in any activity that is illegal in  
that  country; and  
(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal 
there, is illegal in the United States. 
AG ¶ 16(a), 16(d) and 16(e) are established. Record evidence including a CID 
report and Applicant’s admissions show he was fired by Company2 in August 2022 for 
shipping steroids to Country C in violation of U.S. law and that he falsified material facts 
in his August 2022 SCA when he answered no to whether he had failed to file or pay 
federal or state income taxes in the past seven years and deliberately did not disclose he 
failed to timely file and pay federal and state income taxes for TY 2021. 
Conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns under AG ¶ 17 include: 
(a) the  individual made  prompt,  good-faith  efforts to  correct the  omission,  
concealment,  or falsification  before being confronted with the facts;  
(c)  the  offense  is so  minor, or so  much  time  has passed, or the  behavior is 
so  infrequent,  or it happened  under such  unique  circumstances that it is 
unlikely to  recur and  does  not  cast  doubt on  the  individual's reliability,  
trustworthiness, or good judgment;  and  
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability 
to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
AG ¶ ¶ 17(c) and 17(e) are established for the conduct alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. 
Applicant’s termination from employment in Country C occurred more than 2.5 years ago 
under circumstances unlikely to recur, was known to U.S. authorities and his employers, 
and he was returned to the United States after his employment was terminated. 
AG ¶ 17(a) is not established for the conduct alleged in SOR ¶ 2. b. Applicant did 
not make a prompt good -faith effort to correct the falsification of his August 2022 SCA 
before being confronted with the facts on February 11, 2025 . He first disclosed his tax 
problems at hearing in response to Department Counsel ’s question about monthly 
expenses. And though he submitted evidence showing his installment agreement with the 
IRS addressed overdue taxes from TY 2017 through TY 2021 , he testified it was for 
overdue taxes from TY 2021 through TY 2022. He provided no explanation for why he 
deliberately failed to disclose his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns 
for TY 2021 or to pay taxes due at hearing or in response to the SOR amendment. 
AG ¶ 17(c) is not established for the conduct alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b. Applicant’s 
falsification of h is August 2022 SCA is arguably infrequent , but it did not happen under 
unique circumstances unlikely to recur and is not “minor.” It “strikes at the heart of the 
security clearance process.” ISCR Case No. 09 -01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011) His 
conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative j udge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
I have incorporated my comments under Guideline s H, E, and F in my whole -
person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). I also considered 
Applicant's age, education, employment history including his years of direct support to 
deployed military forces, security clearance history, favorable character evidence, efforts 
to resolve his financial problems, and that he has not possessed or used steroids since 
July 2022. I also considered Applicant’s approximately 22 months of drug involvement 
while granted eligibility for access to classified information and his credibility problems 
discussed above. 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, G, 
and H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his substance misuse, 
personal conduct, and financial considerations. Overall, the record evidence leaves me 
with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  H:  AGAINST APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c: Against  Applicant  
Paragraph  2, Guideline  E:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph  2.a:  For  Applicant  
Subparagraph  2.b:   A gainst  Applicant

____________________________ 
Paragraph  3, Guideline  F: AGAINST APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs  3.a-3.e:  For Applicant  
Subparagraph  3.f:  Against Applicant  
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility 
for a security clearance is denied.
