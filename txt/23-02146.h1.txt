Findings of Fact 
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active 
duty in the U.S. military from 1995 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2017. 
He worked for another defense contractor from 2017 until 2020, and he has worked for 
his current employer since 2020. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has 
held since at least 1999. He earned an associate degree in 2012, and he has additional 
college credits. He has never married , and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 21; 
GE 1, 2) 
Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Nation al Security Positions (SF 86) in 
October 2017. He reported that he failed to file his federal and State 1 income tax 
returns for tax years 2009 to 2016. He estimated that he owed $1,700 in back taxes. He 
wrote that he was “[c]urrently filing taxes for all missed years (2009-2016).” 
Applicant was a resident of State 1 while he was in the military, even though , 
from 2009 through 2017, he was stationed and lived overseas or in other states. At least 
for some period, he incorrectly thought that he did not have to file State 1 income tax 
returns. State 1 filed a tax lien of $1,678 against him in June 2014. He paid the taxes, 
and the lien was released in February 2018. He wrote to State 1 seeking information on 
the back returns, but he has not received a response, possibly because of the passage 
of substantial time since the returns were due. The SOR does not allege that Applicant 
did not file his State 1 income tax returns or pay the taxes due, and that information 
cannot be used for disqualification purposes. Applicant moved to State 2 in 2017 after 
his discharge from the military. He then became a resident of State 2 for state income 
tax purposes. (Tr. at 24-26; GE 1, 2, 6) 
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in March 2018. He 
discussed his unfiled federal income tax returns. He stated that , because he was 
typically owed a refund, he felt no urgency to timely file the returns. He stated that he 
had not yet filed his back tax returns, but he collected the necessary documents and 
purchased tax-filing software. He stated that he intended to file all his missing returns 
within seven days. He stated during the interview that he filed State 1 income tax 
returns when it was his home of record, but he did not pay all the income taxes owed 
when they were due. He stated that he paid the State 1 taxes, the tax lien was released, 
and he did not owe any additional State 1 taxes. (GE 6) 
Applicant was interviewed again in April 2018. He indicated that he found 
documentation that he had filed his 2009 through 2011 federal income tax returns. He 
also indicated that he had prepared the federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 
through 2014 and would mail the returns the following week. He provided copies of the 
documents, which established that the 2009 through 2011 federal income tax returns 
had been filed. (GE 6) 
Applicant did not file his 2012 through 2016 federal income tax returns until 2021. 
He provided IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2013 to 2023. He was unable to obtain IRS 
tax transcripts for tax years 2009 through 2012, but he provided copies of the 2010

through 2012 federal returns that he filed with TurboTax. The federal returns and IRS 
tax transcripts indicated that he was due refunds of $1,424 for 2010; $1,210 for 2011; 
$1,230 for 2012; $1,385 for 2013; $1,616 for 2014; $548 for 2015; and $635 for 2016. 
Because the 2012 through 2016 returns were not filed within three years of their due 
date, he forfeited the refunds he would have received for those years . (Tr. at 22-25; 
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, D) 
Applicant submitted another SF 86 in October 2021. He reported that he had filed 
his 2012 through 2016 federal income tax returns, but he had not filed his 2017 through 
2020 federal and state income tax returns. He wrote that he would file those returns 
within the following two weeks. He added, “Tax burden is expected to be low or none 
due to an estimated refund being expected for most/all years. It is understood that I will 
not be eligible for tax refunds for any taxes filed that are older than 3 years.” (GE 1) 
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in December 2021. 
He stated that he had filed his tax returns up through 2017, but he had not yet filed his 
2018 through 2020 federal and state income tax returns. (GE 5) 
Applicant responded to DoD interrogatories in March and April 2023. He provided 
documentation that he had filed his federal and State 2 income tax returns for 2017 
through 2022 in March and April 2023. IRS tax transcripts indicated that he was due 
refunds of $1,545 for 2017; and $1,280 for 2018, which the IRS withheld because his 
returns were not filed within three years of their due date. He received refunds of $1,189 
for 2019; $3,608 plus tax credit refunds of $1,200 and $600 for 2020; and $3,356 plus a 
tax credit refund of $1,400 for 2021. He filed his 2022 federal income tax return on time. 
He owed $171, which he paid in March 2023. He filed his 2023 federal income tax on 
time, and he received a $5,450 refund. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, D) 
Applicant’s State 2 income tax returns and State 2 records indicated he owed 
$195 for 2017; $255 for 2018; and $18 for 2021. H e was due refunds of $34 for 2019; 
$92 for 2020; and $135 for 2022. He made three payments totaling $475 to State 2 on 
April 3, 2023. State 2 certified in September 2024 that Applicant’s income tax returns for 
2017 through 2023 had been filed, and all his state taxes for the period had been paid. 
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4; AE A, C) 
Applicant admitted that he did not take his tax responsibilities as seriously as he 
should have. He thought he would forfeit his refunds, which did occur. He realized that 
the longer he procrastinated, the more difficult it was to file the returns. He now fully 
understands the importance of filing his returns and paying his taxes on time. He filed 
his 2022 and 2023 federal and state income tax returns on time. He assures that all 
future returns and taxes will be filed and paid when they are due. (Tr. at 19 -20, 26-31, 
34) 
Applicant deployed to Qatar and Iraq while he was on active duty. He has a 20% 
disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Tr. at 33-34)

Policies 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 196 0), as amended; DoD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance , the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number o f variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to  live  within  one’s means, satisfy debts,  and  meet  financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness,  and  ability to  
protect  classified  or  sensitive information.  Financial distress can  also be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of,  other  
issues of  personnel security  concern  such  as  excessive gambling, mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol  abuse  or dependence.  An  
individual who  is financially overextended  is at  greater  risk of having  to  
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to  generate funds.  
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: 
(f)  failure to  file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local income  
tax returns or failure to  pay annual Federal,  state, or local income  tax as  
required.  
Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due 
for multiple years. AG ¶ 19(f) is applicable. 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant did not file State 2 income tax return s, as 
required, for tax years 2009 through 2020. Applicant moved to State 2 in 2017, after he 
was discharged from the military. The Government has not established by substantial 
evidence that Applicant was required to file State 2 income tax returns before 2017. The 
language in SOR ¶ 1. b relating to tax year s 2009 through 2016 is concluded for 
Applicant. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur and  does not cast  
doubt on   the  individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good   
judgment;  and  
(g) the  individual has made  arrangements with  the  appropriate  tax  
authority to  file or pay  the  amount owed  and  is in  compliance  with  those  
arrangements.

Because he was typically owed a refund, Applicant felt there was no urgency to 
file his tax returns. He was wrong, but he was correct about being owed refunds by the 
IRS, as he should have received a refund for every year he filed late. He was also 
correct that he would not receive refunds for returns filed more than three years late. My 
calculation shows that he forfeited more than $5,400 in federal refunds. He did owe 
State 2 for several years, but he paid those back taxes in April 2023. All the returns 
were filed by June 2022, before the SOR was issued, and all the taxes were paid. AG ¶ 
20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. 
Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
abiding by well -established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with 
rules and systems is essential for protect ing classified information. See, e.g., ISCR 
Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill 
his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does 
not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those 
granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. 
Bd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes 
paid. 
I accept and I agree with the above Appeal Board jurisprudence, but t here is a 
reason the Security Executive Agent promulgated AG ¶ 20(g), and I cannot ignore it. I 
found Applicant to be honest and truthful, and I give him mitigation credit for his 
honorable military service. I am convinced that he has learned a valuable and costly 
lesson, and that all future returns and taxes will be filed and paid on time. Security 
concerns about Applicant’s finances are mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
 Under the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative judge  must  evaluate  an  
applicant’s eligibility for a  security clearance  by considering  the  totality of the  applicant’s  
conduct and  all  relevant circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider the  
nine  adjudicative  process factors listed at AG  ¶ 2(d):  
(1) The  nature, extent,  and  seriousness of the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of  
rehabilitation  and  other permanent  behavioral changes;  (7) the  motivation  
for the  conduct;  (8) the  potential  for pressure, coercion,  exploitation, or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood  of continuation  or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelin es and the whole -person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s 
honorable military service.

________________________ 
Overall, the r ecord evidence leaves me with out questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:  For  Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  For Applicant  
Conclusion  
It is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility 
for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
