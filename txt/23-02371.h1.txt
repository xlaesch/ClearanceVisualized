Decision 
LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns . 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On February 2, 2024, the Department of Defense (DOD ) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on February 14, 2024, and requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on Nov ember 
21, 2024. 
The hearing was originally scheduled for February 12, 2025, but Applicant did not 
appear. A continuance was granted after he was contacted and stated he was unable to 
connect to the hearing on Microsoft Teams. The hearing was convened as rescheduled 
on April 10, 2025. Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were admitted in evidence 
without objection. The objection to GE 4 was sustained. The objection to GE 7 was 
overruled, and it was admitted in evidence. Applicant testified and called a witness, but 
he did not submit any documentary evidence beyond what he attached to his response

to the SOR. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional documentary 
evidence. He did not submit anything. 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant is a 58- year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since about August 2017. He served on active duty from 1986 until 
he received a general under honorable conditions discharge in 1988. He is a high 
school graduate with certifications. He is not married, but he and his girlfriend have lived 
together for more than 20 years . He has two adult children. His girlfriend has two adult 
children. One of her children lives with them and contributes to the household’s 
finances. (Tr. at 24-29; GE 1) 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including unfiled federal and state 
income tax returns, unpaid federal and state taxes, and delinquent debts. The SOR 
alleges the tax issues and 12 delinquent debts in amounts ranging from $455 to $9,970. 
However, the $1,449 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b and the $1,619 delinquent 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k are duplicate accounts. The debts are listed on one or more 
credit reports obtained in November 2022, August 2023, or April 2025, except that the 
largest debt of $9,970 (SOR ¶ 1.l) is not listed on any credit report. (Applicant’s 
response to SOR; GE 5-7) 
Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Nation al Security Positions (SF 86) in 
August 2022. He reported that he failed to file his 2014 , 2015, 2016, and 2018 federal 
income tax returns; he failed to file his 2016 and 2018 state income tax returns; and he 
owed federal taxes for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 20 18. He also reported a $1,400 credit 
card debt and $2,500 owed on a cosigned loan for a vehicle that had been 
repossessed. (GE 1) 
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in January 2023. He 
discussed his unfiled tax returns. He stated that he had not filed income tax returns 
since 2013. He stated that he did not have the documentation to do the returns. He also 
stated that he did not have the “brain power” to do the returns himself, and he did not 
have the money to pay someone to prepare them for him. He estimated that he owed 
the IRS about $300 or $400 and his state at least $150 for each year. He testified that 
he was a 1099 employee, with more difficult tax returns. He also admitted that he was 
scared of what he would owe. (Tr. at 51-52; GE 2) 
Applicant retained tax professionals to prepare his tax returns and negotiate any 
payment plans with the IRS. He responded to interrogatories in August 2023. He 
provided information that his 2017 through 2022 federal and state income tax returns 
were filed in about April 2023. He also provided some IRS tax account transcripts, wage 
and income transcripts, and tax return transcripts . (Tr. at 53-58; Applicant’s response to 
SOR; GE 2, 3)

The IRS tax account transcript for 2014 was obtained in November 2023. The tax 
return was received on time by the IRS in about March 2015. As of November 2023, 
with taxes, penalties, and interest, he owed $4,847. (GE 2, 3) 
Applicant did not submit IRS tax account transcripts for 2015 and 2016. He 
submitted wage and income transcripts, but they do not establish that returns were filed. 
He did not establish that his federal and state tax returns for 2015 and 2016 have been 
filed. (GE 2, 3) 
The IRS tax account transcript for 2017 indicated that the tax return was received 
by the IRS in October 2023. As of November 2023, with taxes, penalties, and interest, 
Applicant owed $1,624. He indicated in his response to interrogatories that he owed his 
state $154, which did not include penalties and interest. (GE 2, 3) 
The IRS tax account transcripts for 2018 and 2019 do not show that a return had 
been received, possibly because they had not yet been processed. Applicant indicated 
in his response to interrogatories that he owed the IRS $1,203 and $148, and his state 
$102 and $102. Those figures do not include penalties and interest. (GE 2, 3) 
The IRS tax account transcript for 2020 indicated that the tax return was received 
by the IRS in August 2023. As of November 2023, with taxes, penalties, and interest, 
Applicant owed $1,109. He indicated in his response to interrogatories that he owed his 
state $127, which did not include penalties and interest. (GE 2, 3) 
Applicant did not submit IRS tax account transcripts for 2021 and 2022. He 
indicated in his response to interrogatories that he owed the IRS $169 and $745, and 
his state $103 and $103. Those figures do not include penalties and interest. (GE 2, 3) 
Applicant testified that he paid his back state taxes in 2024, but he did not submit 
any documentation of those payments. He thought he owed the IRS about $13,000. He 
has not made any payments . He is waiting to hear from his tax professionals about a 
payment plan with the IRS. (Tr. at 22, 60-65; Applicant’s response to SOR) 
In addition to his tax issues, the SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts in amounts 
ranging from $455 to $9,970. The following is the status of the SOR debts. 
Applicant denied owing the $2,498 debt to a collection company  on behalf of a  
bank,  as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He stated that he did not recognize the creditor. The  
debt is listed on all three credit reports in evidence. When he was interviewed for his  
background investigation in February 2023, he stated that  he contacted the creditor and  
found that it was for an old personal loan he obtained.  He did not  submit any  evidence  
that he disputed the debt with the creditor  or the credit reporting agencies.   (Tr.  at 31-
32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7)  
The $1,449 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b and the $1,619 delinquent debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k are duplicate accounts. Applicant denied owing the debt. He 
stated that the debt was charged off, which he thought meant that it had been paid. He

made some payments on the debt and reduced the balance from $1,619 to $1,449. He 
did not submit any evidence of additional payment s. (Tr. at 33-37, 47 -48; Applicant’s 
response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7) 
Applicant admitted he owed the $1,245 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, but 
he stated that he was making $120 monthly payments. The credit reports support his 
statement that he has been making payments, as the balance on the account has been 
reduced from a high of $1,265 in November 2022 to $215 in May 2025. (Tr. at 37- 39; 
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7) 
Applicant denied owing the $1,206 debt to a collection company on behalf of a 
bank, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. He stated that he did not recognize the collection 
company. He stated that he had an account with the bank, but he paid the debt. When 
he was interviewed for his background investigation in February 2023, he stated that he 
contacted the creditor and was making monthly payments of $24. He likely made a few 
payments because the debt was listed on the November 2022 credit report with a 
balance of $1,258, but it is listed on the two more recent credit reports with a balance of 
$1,206. He did not submit any evidence that he disputed the debt with the creditor or 
the credit reporting agencies. (Tr. at 40-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7) 
Applicant’s statement that he paid the $710 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e 
is accepted. The debt was listed on the November 2022 credit report with a balance of 
$1,085. It was listed on the August 20 23 credit reports with a balance of $710. It is not 
listed on the April 2025 credit report. (Tr. at 41-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 
5-7) 
Applicant admitted he owed the $705 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, but 
he stated that he contacted the creditor and the collection company identified in the 
SOR and neither could locate the account. He stated that he had not contacted either in 
about a year. The debt is listed on all three credit reports. (Tr. at 4 3-44; Applicant’s 
response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7) 
Applicant’s statement that he paid the $647 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g 
is accepted. The debt was listed on the November 2022 credit report with a balance of 
$995. It was listed on the August 2023 credit reports with a balance of $647. It is not 
listed on the April 2025 credit report. (Tr. at 44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7) 
Applicant denied owing the $523 delinquent alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. He stated in 
his response to the SOR that he paid the debt in full. He testified that the debt was 
charged off, which he thought meant that it had been paid. The debt was listed on the 
November 2022 credit report with a balance of $733, but it is listed on the two more 
recent credit reports with a balance of $523. He did not submit any evidence of 
additional payments. (Tr. at 44-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7) 
Applicant’s statement that he paid the $496 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i 
is accepted. The debt was listed on the November 2022 credit report with a balance of 
$820. It was listed on the August 2023 credit reports with a balance of $496. It is not

listed on the April 2025 credit report. (Tr. at 45- 46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 
5-7) 
Applicant’s statement that he paid the $455 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1. j 
is accepted. The debt was listed on the November 2022 credit report with a balance of 
$725. It was listed on the August 2023 credit reports with a balance of $455. It is not 
listed on the April 2025 credit report. (Tr. at 46- 47; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 
5-7) 
Applicant denied owing the $9,970 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1. l. 
Applicant stat ed that he cosigned an auto loan for his daughter, but the vehicle was 
repossessed. The debt is not listed on any of the credit reports in evidence. There is 
insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant is liable for this debt . (Tr. at 4 8-51; 
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5-7) 
Applicant has received financial counseling. He stated that his finances have 
improved. He maintains a written budget. He lives a normal lifestyle, with no 
extravagant spending. He believes he should have about $750 left over each month 
after he pays his bills, debts, and expenses . H e has little in the bank because of 
unexpected expenses. The record was held open for him to submit additional 
information about his finances, but nothing was submitted. (Tr. at 66-72) 
Applicant’s supervisor testified that Applicant is a good employee who follows 
their processes. He is reliable and does a good job for the company. (Tr. at 74-75) 
Policies  
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole -person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness , and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
6 
 
 
 
 
       
 
 
     
    
 
  
  
   
    
 
 
   
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) inability to satisfy  debt s;   
(c) a history of not  mee ting financial  obligations; and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax
 returns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income tax as  
required.  
Applican
t has a history of financial problems, including unfiled federal and state 
income tax returns, unpaid federal and state taxes, and delinquent debts. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. 
There is insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant is liable for the $9,970 
delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l. That allegation is concluded for Applicant. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.k allege duplicate accounts . When the same conduct is 
alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations 
should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03 -04704 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 21, 2005). SOR ¶ 1.k is concluded for Applicant. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
under
 such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast  
doubt  on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good  
judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely  
beyo
nd the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss of employment, a business  
downturn, unexpected medical  emergency,  a death, divorce or  separation,  
clear victimization by predatory lending practices,  or identity theft), and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem  from a  legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications  that the problem is  
being resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to  a go od-faith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt  which i s  the c ause of the problem  and provides  
documented proof to  substantiate the  basis of the dispute or provides  
evidence of actions to resolve the issue;  and  
7 
 
 
 
 
     
   
  
  
     
 
 
   
 
   
     
  
 
   
     
  
 
       
   
   
    
   
 
  
 
   
  
   
 
     
      
  
 
    
   
 
    
   
   
 
(g) the individual  has
  made arrangements with the appropriate tax  
authority to file or pay the amount  owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
Applicant  is credited with paying or paying most of  the debts alleged in SOR  ¶¶  
1.c  ($1,245),  1.e ($710),  1.g ($647), 1. i  ($496), and 1.j ($455). Those debts and  
allegations are mitigated.   
A
pplicant stated that he paid other debts, and he denied owing some other debts 
because they were charged off, which he thought meant that they had been paid. The 
remaining delinquent debts are established by credit reports. Credit reports are 
generally sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case of Guideline F 
security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03- 20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). 
He did not submit any evidence that he disputed the debts with the creditors or the 
credit reporting agencies, and he did not document any additional payments . The 
Appeal Board has held that “it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present 
documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.” See ISCR Case No. 09 -07091 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug . 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04- 10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 
2006)). 
The delinquent debts are problematic, but Applicant’s tax issues have the most 
security significance. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a 
problem with abiding by well -established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018) A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does 
not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those 
granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. 
Bd. May 16, 2018) This is true even when the tax returns are eventually filed, and the 
taxes are eventually paid. 
Applicant retained tax professionals to prepare his tax returns and negotiate any 
payment plans with the IRS. His 2017 through 2022 federal and state income tax 
returns were filed in about April 2023. I also believe it is likely he filed his 2014 state 
income tax return when it was due. AG ¶ 20(g) is applicable to the tax -filing allegations 
for those years (SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n). He did not document that he filed his 2015 and 
2016 federal and state income tax returns, likely because the IRS does not pursue the 
matter after seven years. Since he owed federal and state taxes for every other year, it 
is reasonable to assume that that he may have owed taxes for those years as well. AG 
¶ 20(g) is not applicable to his federal and state tax-filing obligations for 2015 and 201 6 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n). 
Applicant’s state income taxes have been paid. AG ¶ 20(g) is applicable to his 
paid state taxes ( SOR ¶ 1.p). He has not paid his federal taxes, which he thought was 
about $13,000. AG ¶ 20(g) is not applicable to his past-due federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.o). 
8 
 
   
     
    
   
  
    
   
 
 
 
  
 
    
   
 
 
    
  
   
      
  
 
    
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his taxes 
and the unmitigated consumer debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They 
continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
Except as noted above, the mitigating conditions are not applicable. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated despite the presence of some 
mitigation. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent  to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of  
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation  
for the conduct; (8) the potential for  pressure, coercion, exploitation,  or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole- person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s 
favorable character evidence. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.

It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
