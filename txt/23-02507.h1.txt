Decision 
DORSEY, Benjamin R., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns . He 
mitigated the criminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On July 16, 202 4, the Department of Defense (DOD ) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines F (financial 
considerations) and J (criminal conduct). Applicant responded to the SOR on August 6, 
2024, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned 
to me on January 15, 2025. 
The hearing was convened as scheduled on February 27,  202 5, over the 
Microsoft Teams online network. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13 were admitted 
in evidence without objection. I admitted GE 14 over Applicant’s objection, which went 
to the weight of the evidence, as opposed to the document’s admissibility. Applicant 
testified but did not provide any documentary evidence. At Applicant’s request, and after 
I amended the SOR to conform to the evidence as I will discuss below, I reconvened the 
hearing on March 24, 2025, to address the additional SOR allegations by which the

SOR was amended, and to provide the opportunity for the parties to provide closing 
arguments. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open until March 13, 2025, for either 
party to provide post -hearing documentation. Neither party provided post -hearing 
documentation. Despite requesting the reconvened hearing and proper notice being 
provided both during the hearing on February 27, 2025, and via a Notice of Hearing on 
February 28, 2025, Applicant did not appear at the reconvened hearing on March 24, 
2025. 
In an e-mail dated April 3, 2025, Applicant claimed that he wrote down the wrong 
date for the reconvened hearing, instead thinking it was set for March 27, 2025. Noting 
the sufficient notice that he received of the March 24, 2025 reconvened hearing date , 
the passing of the deadline for providing post -hearing documents, the over three- hour 
hearing already held, and the lateness of his e- mail notifying me of the reason for his 
failure to appear, I advised the parties that the record closed on March 24, 2025, and I 
would issue a decision based upon that record evidence with no further proceedings . I 
marked the e-mail correspondence from April 3, 2025, as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA 
received a transcript of the first hearing on March 6, 2025 (Tr. I), and a transcript from 
the reconvened hearing on March 31, 2025 (Tr. II). (Tr. I 118-133; Tr. II 4-7) 
Amendment to the SOR  
On Department Counsel’s motion, to conform to the evidence, and without 
objection, I amended the SOR to include two additional allegations under Guideline F , 
as follows: 
1.p. You failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2022 and  
2023,
 as of the date of the hearing, as required. The tax returns remain  
unfiled.  
1.q. You failed to file a  Sta te  of Missouri  income tax return for  2022 as of  
the date of the hearing, as required. That tax  return remains  unfiled.   
(Tr. I 118-1
33; Tr. II 4-7) 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant  is a 30- year-old employee of  a defense contractor .  He has worked for  
his current employer  since about  January  2023. He  earned a high school diploma in  
2013 and has taken some college courses without  earning a degree. He married  in 
2016, separated in mid- 2017,  and divorced  in  2019. He has  a seven-year-old son. He 
served on active duty  with the U.S. Navy from  2013  until January  2018.  He had an 11-
month deployment in 2013.  He earned a general  discharge  under honorable conditions  
after  a pattern of  misconduct for issues  that I will discuss herein.  (Tr. 25-29, 43-44, 118; 
GE  1, 2)

In the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had 1 5 delinquent accounts 
totaling approximately $50,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1. o). It alleged his failure to file his 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2022 and 2023, as required. It also alleged his 
failure to file State B income tax return for tax year 2022, as required (SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 
1.q). He admitted the Guideline F SOR allegations with the exception of the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.o, which he denied because he claimed he did not live in the jurisdiction where 
the judgment was entered when it was entered. He neither admitted nor denied the 
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q, so I have treated those allegations as having been 
denied. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The Guideline F SOR 
allegations are established through his admissions , t he Government’s March 2023, 
October 2023, and June 2024 credit reports, its case information system records , and 
Applicant’s testimony regarding his failure to file his federal and state income tax 
returns, as required. (SOR; Answer; Tr. I 118-133; GE 2-6, 13, 14) 
The personal loan for about $4,845 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has not been resolved. 
Applicant opened this account in about 2013 when he first entered the military. He 
contacted the creditor to make a payment arrangement in about April 2023, after he had 
his security interview with a DOD investigator. He claimed that he made a payment 
arrangement with the creditor to pay $180 per month until the account is paid in full. He 
claimed he has made some of these payments but has missed some payments as well. 
He claimed that the last time he made a payment on this debt was in November 2024. 
He did not provide any documentation regarding this debt or his resolution efforts. (Tr. I 
25-25, 60-63; GE 2-6) 
The delinquent  accounts  in the amount of  $16,640;  $3,140;  and $912,  alleged in  
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h,  respectively,  have  not been resolved.  These accounts  were  
all owned by the same creditor  but were opened separately. The  accounts in SOR ¶¶  
1.b and 1.c were car loans. The account in SOR ¶ 1.h was  a credit card. In 2018,  
Applicant contacted the creditor and agreed to consolidate these accounts into one  
credit-card account with a balance of  about $20,000. He was required to make  
payments  of $235 per month on this consolidated account. He made those required  
payments until 2020 when he lost his job  and defaulted on the consolidated account.  In  
April 2023, he contacted the creditor  again  and agreed to resume  his payments on the  
consolidated account.  While he has  made approximately ten payments on this account  
since April 2023, he has  missed some of the required payments.  The last  payment  he  
made on the consolidated account was in November 2024. He provided no documents  
to corroborate his resolution efforts on these accounts or the consolidated account.  (Tr.  
I 24-25,  66-79; GE  2-6)  
The insurance accounts in the amounts of $70 and $546 alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d 
and 1.e , respectively, have not been resolved. Applicant opened these accounts in 
December 2022 and became delinquent on the accounts in about February 2023, when 
he changed his insurance coverage to a different carrier. He claimed that he paid off 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
   
    
    
   
 
  
  
 
    
         
 
      
 
    
    
      
  
   
  
      
    
    
    
   
   
  
      
 
       
 
      
   
 
   
  
   
   
     
 
    
  
this account in August 2023. He did not provide any documentation to corroborate this 
payment. (Tr. I 24-25, 79-82; GE 2, 3, 5, 6) 
The student-loan account in the amount of $2,087 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f has not 
been resolved. Applicant enrolled in the college to which this debt is owed and opened 
this account to pay for it in about June 2022. When he enrolled, he arranged to have the 
required $25 per month payment automatically deducted from his credit card. He 
defaulted on the account sometime in February 2023 when the credit card he used to 
deduct the automatic payment stopped working for deductions, possibly because it 
expired. He claimed that he called the creditor in about March 2023 to update the credit 
card from which the payments could be drawn. He claimed the last payment he made 
on this account was in about May 2023. He did not provide any documentation to 
corroborate his resolution efforts on this account. (Tr. I 24-25, 82-85; GE 2, 3, 5, 6) 
The jewelry-store account in the amount of $139 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g has not 
been resolved. Applicant became delinquent on this account in 2018. He claimed he 
paid it off in August 2024, when the creditor contacted him. While he claimed he had a 
receipt for this payment, he did not provide any documentation to corroborate that he 
paid this account. (Tr. I 24-25, 85-86; Answer; GE 2, 3, 5, 6) 
The delinquent child-support debt in the amount of $9,011 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is 
being resolved. While Applicant has been paying on this account through automatic 
deductions in the amount of about $600 per month from his paycheck since March 
2024, he testified that his current balance is approximately $10,000. He testified that 
most of this sum is credited towards his current monthly obligation, but a small 
percentage of it is credited towards his arrearage. While his testimony was somewhat 
unclear, he also claimed that he had some payments automatically withdrawn from his 
paycheck from April 2023 until January 2024. He claimed that he contacted the child 
support agency for State A where the child support is owed to set up this “allotment” in 
March 2023. He provided a document from the relevant agency from State A showing 
that he made required monthly payments for May 2023, June 2023, July 2023, and a 
partial payment for August 2023. (Tr. I 24-25, 58-60, 63-66; GE 2-5) 
The car loan in the amount of $3,779 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j has not been resolved. 
Applicant became delinquent on this account in about 2021 after he hit a deer and 
totaled the car. He testified that his insurance paid off the account except for the unpaid 
interest that was charged off. In April 2023, he made a payment arrangement of $100 
bi-weekly payments beginning in April 2023. He claimed that he had receipts for these 
payments, but he did not provide any such documents. He claimed that he made some 
of these required payments and the last payment he claimed he made was in May 
2024. (Tr. I 24-25, 86-91; Answer; GE 2-5) 
The cable account in the amount of $366 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k has not been 
resolved. Applicant claimed that he paid this account in December 2022. He claimed

that he had a receipt to corroborate that he paid this account, but he did not provide it. 
(Tr. I 24-25, 91-94; Answer; GE 2, 3, 5) 
The delinquent  debt  for airline tickets  in the amount of $2,158 alleged i n S OR  ¶  
1.l has  been resolved.  Applicant  incurred this debt  in 2015  when he borrowed m oney  for  
airline tickets.  He stopped paying on the loan when he left the military in 2017.  He  
provided a document showing that, in November 2019, the Consumer Financial  
Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that this creditor had engaged in deceptive financial  
practices when it overcharged servicemembers and their families for a debt cancellation  
product that was offered in connection with its loans  for  airline tickets.  Applicant did not  
provide any evidence to show that  the CFPB’s finding applied to his delinquency or that  
it obviated his repayment of this debt.  He disputed the debt with a credit reporting  
agency  at  the end of 2022,  because he thought he was paying too much interest on the  
loan,  but he has not  heard back from them, and did not follow up on his  dispute.  He 
tried to contact the creditor but could not get in touch with them. He claimed that , as a  
result of a Google search, he believed  the creditor has gone out  of  business.  (Tr. I 24-
25,  94-99; Answer; GE 2-4)  
The delinquent telecommunications account in the amount of $972 alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.m has not been resolved. Applicant provided a document showing that he 
made a $50 payment on this account in April 2023 and two $40 payments on this 
account in August 2023. However, he did not provide any documentation to show the 
terms of any payment arrangement he had with this creditor or the balance on the 
account. (GE 2-5) 
The judgment entered in 2023 on a residential lease account in the amount of 
$4,820 listed in SOR ¶ 1.n has not been resolved. Applicant was evicted from the 
leasehold apartment in January 2023. The judgment represents two months of unpaid 
rent, but he also failed to make rent payments in July 2022, November 2022, and 
December 2022. He claimed that he made a $4,000 payment towards his balance in 
January 2023, and the $4,820 listed in the SOR represents the remaining balance. He 
claimed he last made a payment on this debt in June 2024. He did not provide any 
documentation corroborating his resolution efforts with respect to this debt. (Tr. I 24-25, 
99-103; Answer; GE 13) 
The judgment entered in 2020 on behalf of a hospital in State A in the amount of 
$1,144 listed in SOR ¶ 1.o has not been resolved. Applicant received in- patient mental 
healthcare at this hospital for a week in 2018. He does not believe that he had health 
insurance at the time. He claimed that he contacted the creditor and made a $115 
payment on this account in June 2024, after he received the SOR. He has not made 
any resolution efforts since this payment. He intends to pay this debt by chipping away 
at it. (Tr. I 24-25, 103-106; Answer; GE 14)

Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2022 and 
2023, as required. Those federal income tax returns remain unfiled. He did not file his 
State B income tax returns for tax year 2022, as required. This State B income tax 
return remains unfiled. He claimed that he will fil e those late income tax returns 
sometime this year. He claimed that he did not file these income tax returns because he 
has not obtained the appropriate W-2 income forms to do so. (Tr. 113-115) 
Applicant had periods of unemployment from October 2022 until November 2022, 
from May 2021 until September 2021, and from January 2020 through March 2020 . He 
was fired by his employer in May 2018 for misconduct because he submitted his 
timecard before he completed the hours he claimed he worked. He claimed his 
discharge from the military was one of the causes of his financial problems. He also 
claimed underemployment and unemployment caused him to fall behind on his financial 
obligations. In August 2023, he provided a personal financial statement wherein he 
claimed that he had a monthly surplus of $1,097. He testified that he earns a little more 
money now than he did when he filled out the personal financial statement. He claimed 
that he has about $95 in a savings account, about $1,100 in a checking account, and 
about $4,000 in a retirement account. He has not received any financial counseling but 
has read some financial planning books written by Dave Ramsey. (Tr. I 24-25, 56-58, 
107-113; GE 3) 
Between 2015 and 2017, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for 
violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) on four occasions , which 
ultimately led to him being separated from the Navy for a pattern of misconduct. He 
received NJP in December 2017 for failing to follow an order, improper watch standing, 
and being disrespectful to a superior (SOR ¶ 2.b). He received NJP again in December 
2017 for failure to obey an order or regulation (SOR ¶ 2.c). In October 2017, he 
received NJP for failure to obey an order or regulation and carrying a concealed 
weapon (SOR ¶ 2.d). In July 2015, he received NJP for assault (SOR ¶ 2.g). In the 
Answer, he admitted these allegations. He complied with the terms of his punishment 
for all of these incidents. (Tr. I 24-25, 30-44; Answer; GE 2, 8, 11) 
In March 2020, Applicant was arrested for battery (SOR ¶ 2.a). He claimed he 
acted in self -defense and the charges were ultimately dropped because the statute of 
limitations passed. In August 2016, he was charged with driving on a suspended license 
and convicted (SOR ¶ 2.e). In March 2016, he was charged with and convicted of 
reckless driving for dr iving 98 miles per hour (MPH) in a 60 MPH zone (SOR ¶ 2.f). In 
2014, he was charged with damage to government property and failure to maintain 
control of vehicle (SOR ¶ 2.h). In the Answer, he admitted these allegations. He has not 
been arrested since March 2020 and has not had a traffic violation since July 2021. (Tr. 
I 23-24, 29-30, 45-54; Answer; GE 2, 7, 9, 10, 12)

Policies  
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole -person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
  
     
   
 
 
 
       
 
 
  
    
  
 
 
 
   
   
  
  
 
    
    
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts,  and meet financial  
obligations may  indicate poor  self-control, lack of judgment, or  
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise  
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness ,  and ability  to 
protect classified or sensitive information.  Financial distress  can also be  
caused or  exacerbated by,  and thus can be a possible indicator of, other  
issues of personnel security  concern such as excessive gambling,  mental  
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol  abuse or dependence.  An 
individual who is financially overextended is at  greater  risk of having to 
engage in illegal  or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a)  inability to satisfy  debt
 s;  
(b)  a history  of not  m eeting financial obligations;  and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax
 returns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income tax as  
required.  
Appli
cant had 15 delinquent accounts totaling about $50,000. These debts have 
been delinquent for years. He did not file his federal income tax return for tax years 
2022 and 2023, as required. He did not file his state income tax return for State B for tax 
year 2022, as required. The above disqualifying conditions are established. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:

(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
under
 such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast  
doubt  on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good  
judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely  
beyo
nd the p erson’s  control  (e.g.,  loss of employment, a business  
downturn, unexpected medical  emergency,  a death, divorce or  separation,  
clear victimization by predatory lending practices,  or identity theft), and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;     
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt  which i s  the c ause of the problem  and provides  
documented proof to  substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides  
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  
(g) the individual  has  made arrangements with the appropriate tax  
authority to file or pay the amount  owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.   
Failur
e to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
abiding by well -established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with 
rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR 
Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill 
his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does 
not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those 
granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. 
Bd. May 16, 2018). 
At the outset, I find that Applicant has met the mitigating conditions in AG ¶ 20(e) 
with respect to the debt in SOR ¶ 1. l. The CFPB found that the creditor for this debt 
engaged in deceptive practices against servicemembers. I find this finding is a 
reasonable basis to dispute the debt and the document describing the CFPB’s finding 
substantiates the basis of the dispute. I find on behalf of Applicant with respect to SOR 
¶ 1.l. 
None of the mitigating factors apply to his remaining debts or to his failure to file 
his income tax returns . Applicant has not resolved any of the remaining SOR debts or 
filed the required income tax returns, so his financial issues are ongoing. While he is in 
the process of resolving his child- support payments, the balance on his arrearage on 
that debt has increased since the SOR was issued.

While the causes of his financial problems were largely beyond his control ( a 
divorce, underemployment, unemployment ), he has not acted responsibly or in good 
faith with respect to his delinquencies. He has made sporadic, minimal payments on 
some of his debts . However, despite claiming that he has surplus funds at the end of 
each month, he has not provided documentation showing payment s on any of these 
debts in months. Moreover, when he claimed that he paid off a debt, he did not provide 
any documents to corroborate any such payments. It is reasonable to expect Applicant 
to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case 
No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). 
Applicant has not remedied his failure to file his federal and State B income tax 
returns for the relevant tax years, nor has he provided evidence that he has arranged 
with the IRS or the State B taxation authority to do so. 
Guideline J, Criminal  Conduct   
The security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 30: 
Criminal activity creates doubt about  an Applicant’s judgment, reliability,  
and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it  calls into question a  person’s  
ability or willingness  to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  
AG ¶ 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: 
(a) a pattern of  mi
 nor offenses, any  one of which on its own would be  
unlikely to affect a  national security eligibility decision, but which in  
combination cast doubt  on the i ndividual's judgment, reliability, or  
trustworthiness;  and  
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admi
ssion, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of  
whether the individual  was formally charged,  prosecuted, or convicted.  
Betw
een 2014 and 2020, Applicant engaged in a pattern of criminal behavior 
both as a civilian and as a sailor with the Navy. He has been charged with and 
convicted for some of these criminal acts. The Navy found that he committed some 
criminal offenses during NJP proceedings. The above disqualifying conditions are 
applicable. 
Conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided 
under AG ¶ 32. The following are potentially applicable: 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
   
   
  
  
     
  
  
 
 
  
 
     
   
 
 
   
  
   
      
      
 
  
    
(a) so much time has  el
 apsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it  
happened under such unusual circumstances ,  that it is unlikely  to recur  
and does not cast doubt  on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or  
good judgment; and  
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited  
to,
 the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,  
compliance with the terms of parole or  probation, job training or higher  
education,  good employment record,  or constructive community  
involvement.  
It has
 been about five years since Applicant was last arrested and about four 
years since he had his last traffic infraction. His mental-health and anger-management 
treatment, as well as his recent decision to abstain from alcohol are positive steps . 
Given this extended time where he has been free from criminal issues, I find that so 
much time has passed since his criminal behavior happened that it is unlikely to recur , 
and it does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I also 
find that these considerations provide evidence of successful rehabilitation. AG ¶¶ 32(a) 
and 32(b) fully apply. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) T he nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent  to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of  
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation  
for the conduct; (8) the potential for  pressure, coercion, exploitation,  or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole- person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis. I have considered his 
military service and the positive steps he has taken to reform his past, illegal behavior. 
Overall, given the lack of progress Applicant has shown in addressing his debts, 
and his failures to file his income tax returns, the r ecord evidence leaves me with

questions and doubts about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I 
conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. He 
mitigated the criminal conduct security concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Subparagraphs 1.m-1.q:   Against Applicant 
Paragraph 2,  Guideline J:   FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs  2.a-2.h:   For Applicant 
Conclusion  
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
