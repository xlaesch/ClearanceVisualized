Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On January 10 , 2020 , Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On December 1, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A, the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility t o Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the

SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On June 5, 2024, 
Applicant provided his response to the SOR. On June 25, 2024, Department Counsel was 
ready to proceed. On March 18, 2025, the case was assigned to another administrative 
judge. On March 25, 2025, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice 
scheduling the hearing on May 9, 2025. (HE 1) On April 10, 2025, the case was 
transferred to me for administrative reasons. The hearing was held as scheduled on May 
9, 2025, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven  exhibits  into evidence, and 
Applicant offered one exhibit into evidence. (Tr.  20-21; GE 1-GE  7; Applicant Exhibit (AE)  
A) There were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr.  
21-22)  On May 22,  2025, DOHA received a  copy  of  the transcript.  The record was not  
held open after  the hearing for post-hearing  documentation. (Tr. 51)      
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a- 1.c, 1.i, 
and 1.k, and he denied the remaining SOR allegations. He also provided some mitigating 
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
Applicant is  44 years old, and he has  been employed working on a Navy training  
aircraft for  the previous 42 months. (Tr.  6,  9) In 2000, he graduated from  high school. (Tr.  
6) He completed two  college courses. (Tr. 7) He was  married in 2000 and divorced in  
2017. (Tr. 7,  25-26) He married his current spouse in 2017,  and he has an eight-year-old 
daughter who lives with him. (Tr. 7-8)  His spouse does not work outside their home. (Tr.  
28)  
Applicant served in the Navy  from 2004 to  2019,  and he received an honorable  
discharge as a petty  officer third class (E-4). (Tr. 9-10, 13) His Navy specialty was avionics  
technician. (Tr. 11) In 2018, he received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for a violation of  
Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (violation of  a lawful regulation)  
because a computer hard drive was left behind unsecured when his unit  moved. (Tr. 10-
11) He did  not explain how his conduct violated a regulation. He received a reduction 
from  petty officer first class (E-6) to petty officer second class (E-5) and f orfeiture of one  
half of one month’s  pay for two months. (Tr. 11) In July  2019,  he received NJP  for  missing  
watch in violation of Article 86, UCMJ. (Tr.  23) In October 2019,  he received NJP for  
violation of Article 107, UCMJ, (making a false statement) because of conflicting  
statements he made concerning his relationship with his spouse pertaining to an incident  
at a hotel. (Tr. 12 -13, 23-24) He was reduced to petty officer third  class (E-4). (Tr. 13)  
Two weeks  after his  third NJP,  he was discharged from  the Navy.  (Tr. 13)  He is  not  
currently receiving disability pay from the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA); however,  
he has applied for VA  disability. (Tr. 25-26)

Applicant had some periods of unemployment after leaving the Navy in December 
2019. (Tr. 29) The longest period of unemployment was from June 2021 until his current 
employment, which started in October 2021. (Tr. 30) His current hourly salary is $45 an 
hour. (Tr. 31) A week before his hearing, he was able to start receiving 10 hours a week 
of overtime pay, which is $67 an hour. (Tr. 32) 
Applicant’s December 1, 2023 SOR alleges, and his March 13, 2020, February 16, 
2023, September 12, 2023, June 14, 2024, and/or May 2, 2025 credit bureau reports 
(CBRs) state, he has 14 delinquent debts totaling $68,954 as follows: 1.a ($15,959) (Tr. 
35; GE 1 at 5); 1.b ($13,202) (Tr. 35; GE 4 at 6); 1.c ($12,227) (Tr. 35-36; GE 6 at 1); 1.d 
($9,169) (Tr. 36; GE 5 at 4); 1.e ($3,087) (GE 2 at 13, 14; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 3) ; 1.f 
($1,093) (GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 4); 1.g ($961) (Tr. 36- 37; GE 4 at 3); 1.h ($743) 
(GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 4); 1.i ($617) (Tr. 37-38; GE 6 at 3); 1.j ($305) (Tr. 37; GE 
4 at 4); 1.k ($10,216) (Tr. 38; GE 2 at 13); 1.l ($865) (Tr. 38; GE 2 at 14); 1.m ($305) (GE 
2 at 15), and 1.n ($205) (Tr. 39; GE 2 at 15). In the last 10 years, he has had two vehicles 
repossessed. (Tr. 49) 
Applicant said he intends to resolve the debts  on his credit report; however, he did  
not make any payments or make any efforts to pay the SOR debts  prior to his hearing.  
(Tr. 22, 35-36) He may have disputed the debts in SOR ¶¶  1.g and 1.l because he was  
unfamiliar with the accounts. (Tr. 36-38, 48) He disputed the debt in SOR ¶  1.n because  
he did not sign a lease for the apartment related to that debt. (Tr. 39) The debts in 1.l  and  
1.n do not  appear  on his May 2, 2025 CBR. (GE 6)  
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.m are medical debts. One or more of them appear on 
each of his CBRs. (Tr. 39; GEs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Applicant said he did not recognize the debts. 
(Tr. 39-41, 48) 
Applicant’s May 2, 2025 CBR shows five non- SOR delinquent debts for $376, 
$2,846, $369, $478, and $585. (Tr. 41; GE 6) A balloon payment of $3,000 was due on 
the debt with a current balance of $2,846 (Debt B) in December 2024. (Tr. 42) Debt B 
related to a vehicle he purchased. (Tr. 48) From January 2025 to April 2025, he made 
four payments to address Debt B of $502, $250, $560, and $503. (AE A) After he resolves 
Debt B, he intends to continue to address his other debts. (Tr. 42) 
Applicant owes about $3,000 in delinquent federal income taxes. (Tr. 44) A creditor 
may have forgiven a debt, and the IRS may have decided this was income, which would 
result in additional taxes being due. (Tr. 44) He has not attempted to establish a payment 
plan with the IRS. (Tr. 44) 
Applicant has  $1,700 in his checking account and about $37,000 in his retirement  
account. (Tr. 45) He  discussed his finances with a financial counselor, and he has  a  
remainder of about $800 each month after paying his  bills. (Tr. 45- 46) A financial  
counselor  provided advice to him about how to establish his  financial  responsibility.  (Tr.  
50) He emphasized that he intends to pay  his debts. (Tr. 53-54)

Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the

facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The bur den of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts,  and meet financial  
obligations may  indicate poor  self-control, lack of judgment, or  
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise  
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to  
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial  distress can  also be  
caused or exacerbated by,  and thus can be a possible indicator of, other  
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,  mental  
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An  
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to  
engage in illegal  or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for  the financial  
considerations  security concern in ISCR Case No.  11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May  1,  2012)  
(citation omitted) as follows:  
T
his concern is broader than the possibility that  an applicant might  
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in  
satisfaction of  his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the  
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge  
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control,  
judgment,  and other qualities  essential to protecting the national secrets as  
well as  the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct  under any of the Guidelines  
and an applicant’s  security  eligibility.  
In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally  
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations  
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden  
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for  
the debt or that  matters in mitigation apply.

AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that are established in this case: “(a) 
inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Discussion of 
the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20, which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  so inf requent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  problem  were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has recei ved or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- faith ef fort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and  
(e) the indi
vidual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance  
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or  maintenance of  
a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown,  913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  
Cir. 1990),  cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government  
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts  to the 
applicant to rebut or  mitigate those concerns.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The  
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is  that  articulated in  
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access  
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
Directive, Enclosure 2  ¶ 2(b).

AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. “It is also well established that an applicant’s ongoing, 
unpaid debts demonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can be viewed as recent 
for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 
27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017)). 
Applicant was divorced in 2017, and he was unemployed for several months after 
his discharge from the Navy. These factors are circumstances largely beyond his control, 
which adversely affected his finances. However, “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] financial 
difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] 
control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the applicant] has since 
acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case 
No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007). The DOHA Appeal Board has said: 
[A]n applicant  must act responsibly given his or her circumstances and  
develop a reasonable plan for repayment,  accompanied by concomitant  
conduct even if it may  only provide for the payment of  debts one at  a time.  
ISCR Case No. 07 -06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21 , 2008). What  constitutes  
responsible behavior  depends on the facts  of  a given case and the fact that  
an applicant's debts will not be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may  
be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. 09- 08462 at 4. Relevant  to  
the equation is an assessment  as to whether  an applicant acted responsibly  
given  [his or] her limited resources  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at  3-
4 (App. Bd. Oct.  29, 2009).  
ADP Case No. 23-00547 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2024). 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $68,954. “[A] single debt can 
be sufficient to raise Guideline F security concerns.” ISCR Case No. 19-02667 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Nov. 3, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 14- 05366 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2016)). 
“Additionally, a single debt that remains unpaid over a period of years can properly be 
characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Id. 
Applicant disputed the SOR ¶¶ 1.l ($865) and 1.n ($205) debts, and they have 
been dropped from his May 2, 2025 CBR. He is credited with mitigation of those two 
debts. 
Applicant indicated several other SOR debts were dropped from his credit report. 
“[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence 
of debt resolution.” ISCR Case No. 14- 05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires 
removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first 
date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of 
limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. Debts may be dropped from 
a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a 
creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company’s request for information, or 
when the debt has been charged off.

Applicant’s IRS debt, NJPs, and new delinquent debts on his May 2, 2025 CBR 
were not alleged in the SOR. These issues will not be considered for disqualification 
purposes; however, they will be considered: “(a) in assessing [his] credibility; (b) in 
evaluating [his] evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in 
considering whether [he] has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying 
the whole-person concept.” ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). 
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance and noted: 
The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important  factor in  
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who  
begins to resolve financial problems  only after being placed on notice that  
his clearance was in jeopardy  may lack the judgment  and self-discipline to  
follow rules  and regulations over time or when there is  no immediate threat  
to his  own interests. In this case,  [taking financial actions]  after submitting  
his SCA, undergoing his background interview, or receiving the  SOR  
undercuts the weight such remedial action might  otherwise merit.  
In this instance, Applicant took some actions to pay Debt B in 2025 after the SOR 
was issued. However, the Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an 
applicant has purportedly corrected his or her financial problem, and the fact that 
applicant is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude 
careful consideration of applicant’s security worthiness considering his longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. 
June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an applicant’s course of 
conduct and employing an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support 
approval of access to classified information). 
Under all the circumstances, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to 
mitigate any of the debts in the SOR except for the debts in ¶¶ 1. l and 1.n. I am not 
confident that he will establish payment plans, pay, or otherwise resolve most of the 
unresolved SOR debts, and maintain his financial responsibility. Financial considerations 
security concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable

Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is 44 years old, and he has been employed working on a Navy training 
aircraft for the previous 42 months. In 2000, he graduated from high school. He completed 
two college courses. He served in the Navy for 15 years, and he received an honorable 
discharge. He has applied for a VA disability rating. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations analysis section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the 
evidence of mitigation. He did not establish that he was unable to make more timely and 
significant progress resolving his SOR debts. The financial evidence raises unmitigated 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. 
See AG ¶ 18. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards resolution of his debts and maintenance of his financi al 
responsibility, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to 
grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to classified 
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
