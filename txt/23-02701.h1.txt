Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is granted. 
Statement  of the Case  
On January 2, 2023 , Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On December 11, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960 ); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992 ), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A , the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be g ranted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On

May 29, 2024, Applicant provided his response to the SOR. On September 24, 2024, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On October 3, 2024, the case was assigned 
to me. On October 9, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a notice scheduling the hearing on November 19, 2024. (HE 1) The hearing was held as 
scheduled, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant offered one exhibit into evidence. (Tr. 10, 14-16; GE 1-GE 4; Applicant Exhibit 
(AE) A) There were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
(Tr. 15-16) On December 2, 2024, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. Applicant 
provided one exhibit after the hearing , which was admitted into evidence. (AE B) On 
January 23, 2025, the record closed when the exhibit was received. (AE B) 
Some  details were  excluded  to  protect Applicant’s right to  privacy. Specific   
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.

Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority 
to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether 
an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. 
The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information . 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant ’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria

listed therein and an applicant ’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once  the  Government establishes a  disqualifying  condition  by substantial 
evidence, the  burden  shifts to  the  applicant to  rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate  the  
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the  ultimate burden of demonstrating  that it  
is clearly consistent with  the  national interest  to  grant or continue  his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR   Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd. Dec. 19,  2002). The  burden  of 
disproving  a  mitigating  condition  never shifts  to  the  Government.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  
02-31154  at 5  (App.  Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance  determinations should err,  
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to  live  within  one’s means, satisfy debts, and  meet financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness to  abide  by rules  and  regulations, all  of which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness,  and  ability to  
protect classified  or sensitive information. Financial distress can  also  be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus  can  be  a  possible  indicator  of,  other  
issues of personnel security  concern such  as  excessive  gambling, mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol  abuse  or dependence. An  
individual  who  is financially overextended  is  at  greater  risk of  having  to  
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to  generate funds.  
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than  the  possibility that an  applicant might  
knowingly  compromise  classified  information  in order to  raise  money in  
satisfaction  of his or her debts. Rather, it requires  a  Judge  to  examine  the  
totality of an  applicant’s financial history and  circumstances.  The  Judge  
must consider pertinent evidence  regarding  the  applicant’s self-control,  
judgment,  and  other qualities  essential to  protecting  the  national secrets  
as well as the  vulnerabilities inherent in  the  circumstances.  The  Directive 
presumes a  nexus  between  proven  conduct under any  of the  Guidelines  
and  an  applicant’s security eligibility.  
AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.”

“[A]  single  debt  can  be  sufficient  to  raise  Guideline  F security concerns.” ISCR   
Case  No.  19-02667  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Nov.  3,  2021) (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  14-05366  at 3  
(App.  Bd. Feb.  5,  2016)). “Additionally, a  single  debt  that  remains  unpaid  over  a  period  
of years can properly be characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Id.  
The record establishes the disqualifying condition s in AG ¶ ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). 
Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required . 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 , which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  lon g  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur and  does not cast 
doubt on  the  individual’s current   reliability, trustworthiness,   or  good  
judgment;  
(b) the  conditions that resulted  in th e  financial problem  were  largely beyond  
the  person’s control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business downturn, 
unexpected  medical emergency, a  death, divorce  or separation, clear 
victimization  by  predatory lending  practices,  or identity  theft),  and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has  rece ived  or  is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as  a  non-profit  credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is  
being resolved or is under control;  
(d) the  individual initiated  an d  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and  
(e) the  individual has a  reasonable basis to  dispute  the  legitimacy of the  
past-due  debt which  is the  cause  of the  problem  and  provides documented  
proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or provides  evidence  of 
actions to resolve the issue.  
The  Appeal Board in ISCR  Case  No.  10-04641  at 4  (App. Bd.  Sept.  24, 2013)  
explained  Applicant’s responsibility for  proving  the  applicability of  mitigating  conditions  
as follows:  
Once  a  concern arises regarding  an  Applicant’s security clearance   
eligibility,  there is a  strong  presumption  against  the  grant or maintenance  
of a  security clearance.  See  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913  F. 2d  1399, 1401  (9th  
Cir. 1990),  cert.  denied, 499  U.S. 905  (1991).  After the  Government 
presents  evidence  raising  security concerns, the  burden  shifts to  the

standard applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions is that articulated  in  
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning  personnel being  considered  for  
access to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in favor of  the  national  
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2  ¶ 2(b).  
AG ¶  20(a) does  not apply  to  the  SOR debts. “It is also  well established  that an  
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts demonstrate  a  continuing  course of conduct and  can  
be  viewed  as  recent for purposes   of  the  Guideline  F  mitigating  conditions.” ISCR  22-
02226  at  2  (App.  Bd. Oct.  27,  2023) (citing  ISCR  Case  No. 15-06532  at 3  (App.  Bd.  Feb. 
16, 2017)).  
Applicant was underemployed during the COVID 19 pandemic; he was 
unemployed for three months in 2021; and he has been on Workers’ Compensation since 
March 2023. Some of his debts are related to his medical care. These factors are 
circumstances largely beyond his control , which adversely affected his finances . 
However, “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, 
due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still 
consider whether [the applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing 
with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007). 
Applicant’s history of non-payment of several debts has important security 
implications. See ISCR Case No. 20-01004 at 3 (App. Bd. June 28, 2021) (“Resolution 
of a delinquent debt does not preclude further inquiry or examination regarding it. Even 
if an alleged debt has been paid or canceled, a Judge may still consider the 
circumstances underlying the debt as well as any previous actions or lapses to resolve 
the debt for what they reveal about the applicant’s worthiness for a clearance”) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017)). 
Two Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 
20(b) in cases where there are limited financial resources and circumstances beyond an 
applicant’s control adversely affecting his or her finances. In ISCR Case No. 09 -08533 
(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010) , the applicant had $41, 871 in delinquent credit -card debt and 
defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant 
filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 
1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been 
unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was 
inconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG 
¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely 
to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved 
at the time the Administrative Judg e’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board 
also decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of 
the absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack 
of trustworthiness. Id. at 4. I note that Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability 
of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition never 
shifts to the Government.

Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board 
addressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the 
ability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted “it will be a long time at best before 
he has paid” all of h is creditors. Id. at 3. The applicant was living on unemployment 
compensation at the time of h is hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a 
circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: 
However, the  Board has previously noted  that an  applicant is not required  
to  be  debt-free  nor to  develop  a  plan  for paying  off  all  debts  immediately or  
simultaneously. All  that is required  is  that an  applicant act responsibly 
given  his [or her] circumstances  and  develop  a  reasonable  plan  for  
repayment,  accompanied  by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which  
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.  
ISCR  Case  No.  08-06567  at  3  (App. Bd. Oct.  29, 2009)  (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  07-06482
at 3  (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)). The  applicant in  ISCR  Case  No.  08-06567  used  his limited
resources to  (1) resolve  some  of his debts;  (2) had  a  repayment plan  for the  remaining
debts; and  (3) took “reasonable actions   to  effectuate  that plan.” Id.  The  Appeal Board
remanded  the  Administrative  Judge’s decision  because  it did not “articulate  a  satisfactory
explanation  for his  conclusions,” emphasizing  the  Administrative  Judge  did  “not  explain[]
what he  believes that applicant  could or should  have  done  under  the  circumstances that
he  has not already done  to  rectify his poor financial condition, or why the  approach  taken
by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light of his limited circumstances.” Id.  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges he has 17 delinquent debts totaling $23,145. He resolved 
or is resolving seven SOR debts. SOR ¶ 1.d ($1,480) is a duplication of SOR ¶ 1.e 
($1,480). Applicant has an established payment plan for SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($1,480) , 1.h 
($924), 1.k ($727), and 1.n ($646) ; and he has reduced the current balances to $555, 
$699, $487, and $0, respectively. Applicant settled the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q ($143) for less 
than the full amount. 
Applicant was unsure  if he  paid  the  debts  in SOR ¶¶  1.f  ($1,093),  1.j ($819),  and  
1.p  ($312), and  they  could have  been  paid. They do  not  appear on  his September 24,  
2024 CBR. He is credited with  paying  or resolving  these  three  debts.  
Applicant has disputed the amounts of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($923) and 1.l 
($724). He is willing to settle the debts once a reasonable amount is established. He did 
not provide documentation showing the basis of the dispute, and he does not receive full 
mitigating credit under AG ¶ 20(e). 
Applicant provided evidence that he has been paying four non-SOR debts, and 
the payments started before the SOR was issued. He reduced the balance owed on a 
credit card from $3,052 to $1,210. He reduced his vehicle loan from $13,790 to $3,589. 
He reduced a credit -card debt of $1,024 to $12. Applicant has a non -SOR debt for 
$1,560, and he is making payments to address the debt.

Applicant established mitigation under AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d). He showed good 
faith in his overall handling of h is finances. I found h is statement at h is hearing to be 
candid and credible. He indicated he will pay h is debts and establish his financial 
responsibility. Future delinquent debts are unlikely to recur , and t here are clear 
indications his financial problems are in the process of being resolved . His history of 
handling his finances does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
judgment. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole -person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature, extent,  and  seriousness  of the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the  frequency and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the  time  of the  conduct; (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of 
rehabilitation  and  other  permanent behavioral  changes;  (7) the  motivation  
for the  conduct; (8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood  of continuation  or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole -person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is a  37-year-old armed  security  officer, who  has worked  for a  
government contractor since  January 2023. He has been  on  Workers’  Compensation
since March 2023.  
  
Applicant has a history of delinquent debt. In 2013, Applicant’s nonpriority 
unsecured debts were discharged in bankruptcy. His SOR alleges he has 17 delinquent 
debts totaling $23,145. The evidence supporting grant of a security clearance is detailed 
in the financial considerations analysis section, supra, and this evidence is more 
substantial than the evidence against mitigation. Underemployment, unemployment, and 
injuries harmed his finances. He acted re sponsibly under the circumstances within his 
limited means. He resolved or is resolving 10 SOR debts. He is making payments on 
four non-SOR debts. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole -person analysis in 
financial cases stating:

. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR . All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simulta neously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). Applicant has demonstrated a meaningful financial track record of 
repayment of overdue creditors and otherwise resolved debts. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances 
in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial considerations security 
concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:   FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs  1.a  through 1.q:  For Applicant 
Conclusion  
I conclude  that  it  is clearly consistent  with  the  interests of  national security of the  
United  States to  grant  or continue  Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to   
classified information.  Eligibility for access to  classified information is granted.
