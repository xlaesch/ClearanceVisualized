This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline s F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Clearance is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 23, 2022. On 
January 22, 2024, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) sent her 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E .The 
DCSA acted under Executive Order ( Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 19 60), as amended ; Department of Defense 
(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review

Applicant answered the SOR on April 29, 2024, and requested a hearing. On June 
4, 2024, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add SOR ¶ 1.t, alleging an additional 
delinquent debt. Applicant did not object to the amendment. Department Counsel was 
ready to proceed on July 8, 2024. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2025. On 
January 14, 2025, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals notified Applicant that the 
hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on February 21, 2025. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits 1 through 7 were admitted in 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A 
through F, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript on March 
3, 2025. I held the record open until March 21, 2025, to enable Applicant to submit 
additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX G through M, which were 
admitted without objection. The record closed on March 21, 2025. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in the SOR and 
the amendment to the SOR. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. 
Applicant is a  36-year-old travel coordinator employed  by a  federal contractor since 
February 2022. She  has worked  for federal contractors since  July 2019. She  received  a  
security clearance  in  February 2019. She  completed  high  school and  some  college  
courses but  does  not have  a  degree.  She  married  in  February  2010,  separated  in  2018,  
and  divorced  in  October 2020.  She  received  no  financial  assistance  from  her  husband  
after  they separated. Her ex-husband  is in  jail. (Tr. 28) She  has nine  children  and  a  one-
year-old granddaughter, who  all  live  with  her.  (Tr. 16) She  received  a  security clearance  
in February 2019.  
The SOR as amended alleges 20 delinquent debts , which are reflected in credit 
reports dated April 6, 2022 (GX 2) and May 30, 2024 (GX 3) . At the beginning of the 
hearing, I granted Department Counsel’s motion to withdraw the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.s. 
(Tr. 11-12) The evidence concerning the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.r and 1.t 
is summarized below. 
SOR 1.a: car loan charged off for $21,215. Applicant testified that this debt arose 
when her car was stolen and wrecked in 2019. Her insurance company (alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.q below) refused to pay the balance on the loan . (Tr. 40-42) The lender for the car 
loan offered to settle the debt for $3,182. (AX G) She accepted the offer on May 23, 2024, 
and paid the agreed amount on May 30, 2024. (AX E). 
SOR ¶ 1.b: apartment rent placed for collection of $2,303. Applicant explained 
the circumstances of this debt when she was interviewed by a security investigator in July 
2022. She stated that she moved out of an apartment in 2018 after giving the apartment 
manager the required 30-day notice and received an acknowledgment of the notice from 
the manager. She provide d the security investigator with a copy of the notice . In 2019, 
she noticed that her credit report reflected past-due rent . The May 2024 credit report 
reflects that the debt is disputed. (GX 3 at 4) The evidence reflects that she has a 
reasonable basis for disputing this debt.

SOR ¶ 1.c: furniture rental placed for collection of $1,872. In February 2025, 
Applicant agreed to settle the debt for around $370, to be paid in six monthly installments 
by automatic withdrawal from a bank account. (AX A) The debt is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.d: furniture rental placed for collection of $1,660. Applicant settled 
this debt for $1,000, which she is paying in monthly installments. As of the date of the 
hearing, she still owed about $200 on this debt. (AX B; Tr. 52-53) It is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit-card account charged off for $597. Applicant settled this debt 
for $300 and is making monthly payments of $57.75. (AX J; AX L) It is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.f: overdraft fee charged off for $179. Applicant made a payment 
agreement providing for monthly $10 payments. As of the date the record closed, her 
payments were current. (AX M) It is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g: overdraft fee charged off for $118. Applicant testified that this debt 
was paid in 2023 or 2024. (Tr. 55) The May 2024 credit report reflects that this debt was 
settled for less than the full amount in April 2024. (GX 3 at 5-6) 
SOR ¶ 1.h: telecommunications bill for $62. Applicant presented no evidence 
regarding this debt. It is not resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j: two medical bills for $59 each. Applicant present ed no 
evidence regarding these debts. 
SOR ¶  1.k: credit-card account  past  due  for $367  with  a  balance  of  $1,382.  
Applicant presented  no evidence regarding this debt.  
SOR ¶ 1.l: credit -card account past due for $172 with a balance of $788. 
Applicant presented no evidence regarding this debt. 
SOR ¶ 1. m: credit-card account past due for $187 with a balance of $482. 
Applicant presented no evidence regarding this debt. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o: medical bills for $50 each, placed for collection. Applicant 
presented no evidence regarding these debts. 
SOR ¶ 1.p: deficiency after automobile repossession, charged off for $5,884. 
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she provided documentary evidence that this debt was 
resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.q: $145 debt to auto insurance company for vehicle alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.a. Applicant testified that she paid this debt. (Tr. 42) The debt is not reflect ed in the 
credit reports from April 2022, May 2024 , or February 2025 . (GX 3 ; GX 4; GX 7 ) It is 
resolved.

SOR ¶ 1.r: past-due rent placed for collection of $4,161. Applicant testified that 
she contacted this creditor in May 20 24, seeking to settle the debt. She provided 
documentation of her conversation with the creditor, who was unable to locate her 
account because she does not know the account number. (AX K; Tr. 47) The debt is not 
reflected on the credit reports submitted at the hearing. (GX 2; GX 3) Applicant has made 
a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. 
SOR ¶ 1.t : unsatisfied judgment for $7,195. This judgment against Applicant 
was entered in September 2018. She submitted evidence of payments made twice a 
month in varying amounts from November 2018 to December 2021. She notified th e 
creditor’s attorney in June 2024 that she believed the debt was satisfied, and the attorney 
responded that she still owed $200.79. In July 2024, she notified the attorney that sh e 
would make the final payment. (AX B) However, as of the date of the hearing, she had 
not yet made the final payment. (Tr. 61) The debt is not yet fully resolved. 
Among  the  documents submitted  by Applicant after the  hearing  was 
documentation  of  a  debt  for property  in  a  resort community. The  debt is reflected  in  the  
February 2025  credit  report  (GX 7), which  shows that the  debt  was  incurred  in  June  2021  
for $12,591  and  was 180  days past due. Applicant’s documentation  shows that the  debt  
was settled  for $3,500, to  be  paid  over 12  months at $292  per month, starting  in February  
2025. She  made  the  first payment on  February 28,  2025,  one  week after the  hearing.1  
(AX F)  
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified her SCA by failing to 
disclose the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.s. She answered “No” to all the 
financial questions , including questions regarding judgments entered against her, 
involuntary repossessions, defaults on loans, debts turned over to collection agencies , 
garnishments, and any debts delinquent for more than 120 days. (GX 1 at 54) When 
Department Counsel asked her why she did not disclose her delinquent debts in her SCA, 
she responded, “I don’t know . . . I read the questions wrong. And I think I really wasn’t 
paying attention to the question that was being asked.” (Tr. 68) 
Applicant currently earns about $9 3,000 per year after receiving a pay raise in 
November 2024. She previously earned about $88,000 per year. Her take-home pay is 
about $6,000 per month. She occasionally drives a ride -share car to generate more 
income. She receives government assistance in the form of a 70% housing voucher and 
$800 per month for food. She has about $17,380 in her retirement account. She drives a 
2019 compact car that was a gift from her church . (Tr. 27 -35) She has never received 
credit counseling. (Tr. 36) 
1  This  debt was  not alleged  in the SOR,  and I  have considered  it only  for th e limited purposes of assessing  
Applicant’s  credibility, to evaluate  her  evidence  of mitigation, and  in  my  whole-person  analysis. See  ISCR  
Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).

Policies  
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan , 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An a dministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for acc ess to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial 
evidence is “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.” See ISCR 
Case No. 17 -04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is “less than the weight of the 
evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence 
does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.” 
Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). “Substantial evidence” 
is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area 
Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 Once  the  Government establishes a  disqualifying  condition  by substantial 
evidence, the  burden  shifts to  the  applicant  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or mitigate  the  
facts.  Directive ¶  E3.1.15. An  applicant has  the  burden  of proving  a  mitigating  condition,  
and  the  burden  of  disproving  it never shifts  to  the  Government. See  ISCR  Case  No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
      
       
     
         
       
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden  of demonstrating  that it is clearly consistent  
with the national interest to grant or continue  his security clearance.”  ISCR Case No. 01-
20700  at 3  (App. Bd. Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance  determinations should  err, if 
they must, on the side  of denials.” Egan  at 531.   
Analysis  
Guideline  F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to  live  within  one's means, satisfy debts, and  meet financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to  
protect classified  or sensitive information. . . . An  individual who  is financially  
overextended  is at greater risk of having  to  engage  in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 Applicant’s admissions  and  the  evidence  submitted  at the  hearing  establish  the  
following disqualifying  conditions under this guideline:   
AG ¶  19(a): inability to  satisfy debts;  and  
AG ¶  19(c): a  history of not meeting financial obligations.  
The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
AG ¶  20(a): the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was  so  infrequent,  or  
occurred  under such  circumstances that it  is unlikely to  recur and  does not  
cast doubt  on  the  individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good   
judgment;  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
   
 
 
 
     
         
 
 
           
           
               
    
 
        
   
 
  
AG ¶  20(b): the  conditions that  resulted  in  the  financial problem  were largely 
beyond  the  person's control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business  
downturn, unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death, divorce  or separation,  
clear victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices, or identity  theft),  and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
AG ¶  20(c): the  individual has  received  or is receiving  financial counseling  
for the  problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as a  non-profit 
credit counseling  service, and  there  are clear indications  that the  problem 
is being resolved or is under control;   
AG ¶  20(d): the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve  debts;  and.   
AG ¶  20(e): the  individual has a  reasonable basis to  dispute  the  legitimacy  
of the  past-due  debt which  is the  cause  of the  problem  and  provides  
documented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or provides  
evidence of actions to  resolve the issue.  
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are recent, frequent, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant encountered  several conditions largely  
beyond  her control. Her  automobile  was stolen  and  wrecked  in 2019. She  and  her  
husband  separated  in  2018  and  divorced  in 2020. She  received  no  financial support for  
herself,  her nine  children, and  her one  grandchild  after they separated. There is no  
evidence  that the  births  of  her nine  children  were  conditions  largely beyond  her control,  
but her unmarried  daughter’s birth  of a  child  was a  condition  largely  beyond  her control.  
However, she  has  not  acted  responsibly.  At the  hearing,  she  offered  no  explanations  for  
the  unresolved  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.h-1.o.  Her  purchase  of  property  in a  resort  
community in June  2021, before  resolving  the  debts alleged  in the  SOR, raises doubts  
about her financial responsibility.   
AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not received financial counseling, and 
her the record does not show “clear indications” that her financial problems are under 
control. 
AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c-1.g, and 1.p-1.r. 
It is not fully established for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.t, because Applicant has not 
shown that she made the final payment on the debt. It is not established for the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.o. 
AG ¶ 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. The record reflects 
that Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute this debt.

Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
Conduct involving  questionable judgment, lack of candor,  dishonesty,  or  
unwillingness to  comply with  rules and  regulations can  raise  questions  
about an  individual's  reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to  protect  
classified  or sensitive  information.  Of  special  interest is any  failure to  
cooperate  or provide  truthful and  candid answers during  national  security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
The relevant disqualifying condition is AG ¶ 16(a): 
[D]eliberate  omission, concealment,  or falsification  of relevant facts from  
any personnel  security questionnaire, personal history statement,  or similar  
form  used  to  conduct investigations,  determine  employment qualifications,  
award  benefits or status, determine  national security eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  
 When  a  falsification  allegation  is controverted, as in this case, the  Government has  
the  burden  of proving  it. An  omission,  standing  alone, does  not prove  falsification. An  
administrative judge  must  consider the  record evidence  as  a  whole to  determine  an  
applicant’s state  of  mind  at the  time  of  the  omission.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  03-09483  at  4  
(App.  Bd.  Nov.  17, 2004). An  applicant’s experience  and  level of education  are  relevant  
to  determining  whether  a  failure to  disclose  relevant information  on  a  security clearance  
application was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep.  9, 2010).  
Applicant is a mature adult who has worked for federal contractors since 2019. 
She is not a neophyte in the security-clearance process, having held a clearance for most 
of her federal service. She offered no cogent or persuasive explanation for her negative 
answers to all the questions about financial delinquencies . I conclude that AG ¶ 16(a) is 
established. 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
AG ¶  17(a): the  individual made  prompt,  good-faith  efforts  to  correct the  
omission, concealment,  or falsification  before  being  confronted  with  the  
facts;  and  
AG ¶  17(c):  the  offense  is so  minor, or so  much  time  has passed, or the  
behavior is so infrequent,  or it happened under such unique circumstances  
that it  is unlikely to  recur and  does not cast doubt on  the  individual's  
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
AG ¶ 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct the omissions 
until she was confronted with the evidence.

AG ¶ 17(c) is not established. Her falsification of her SCA is arguably infrequent, 
but it is recent and did not happen under unique circumstances . Falsification of an SCA 
is not “minor.” It “strikes at the heart of the security clearance process.” ISCR Case No. 
09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) 
Whole-Person  Analysis   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole -person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate 
an appellant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the appellant’s conduct and 
all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person 
analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns 
raised by her delinquent debts and personal conduct. 
Formal Findings  
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:  For Applicant  
Subparagraphs  1.h-1.o:   Against Applicant  
Subparagraphs  1.p-1.r:  For Applicant  
Subparagraph  1.s:  Withdrawn  
Subparagraph  1.t:  For Applicant

Paragraph  2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph  2.a:  Against Applicant  
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
