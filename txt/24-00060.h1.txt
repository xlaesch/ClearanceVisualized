Decision  
LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns . 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On February 26, 2024, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on March 19, 2024, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 21, 
2024. 
The hearing was convened as scheduled on January 28, 202 5. Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified and submitted Appli cant Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. 
The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He 
submitted an email with attached documents. The attached documents were not well 
organized. I have attempted to organize them in a logical manner. I have marked them 
AE B through G and admitted them in evidence without objection.

Findings of Fact  
Applicant is a 48- year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since about December 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. 
military from 1998 until he was honorably discharged in 2005. He attended college for a 
period without earning a degree. He married for the second time in 2002 after his first 
marriage ended in divorce in 2001. He has three adult stepchildren. (Tr. at 17, 27, 39, 
43; GE 1) 
Applicant has a history of financial problems. He and his wife filed a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy case in 2009, and their debts were discharged the same year. (Tr. at 23- 24; 
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6) 
Applicant’s wife developed a debilitating disease in 2006 and has been unable to 
work. The copayment for her medication is about $500 per month. He became the sole 
provider for his wife and stepchildren, and at times, his stepchildren’s children. He had 
periods of underemployment and unemployment. He was laid off from his previous job 
in December 2019 and when the COVID -19 pandemic hit, he was unable to find a job 
until December 2020. (Tr. at 16, 20-28; GE 1, 7) 
The SOR alleges the 2009 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a); an auto loan that was $456  
past due with a $35,368 balance (SOR  ¶ 1.c); and 22 miscellaneous delinquent debts in  
amounts ranging from $338 to $14,024 and totaling about $57,000. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and  
1.d to 1.x) Applicant  admitted owing all the debts in his response to the SOR, but he  
added that the debts  alleged in SOR  ¶¶  1.p and 1.q were paid (addressed below). All  
the debts are listed on one or  more credit reports. (Applicant’s response to SOR;  GE  4,  
5)  
Applicant contracted with a debt resolution company in March 2024. He enrolled 
$49,139 in debt in the company’s program. He agreed to pay $381 by recurring deposits 
every two weeks into an escrow account. The company agreed to negotiate settlements 
with his creditors, and pay the creditors, minus the company’s fees, from the escrow 
account. The deposits increased to $393 in June 2024. Applicant made all the deposits. 
As of February 5, 2025, he had paid $8,974 into the escrow account and $8,571 was 
withdrawn for payments and fees, leaving a balance of $403. (Tr. at 16-19; AE B-D) 
The following is the status of the SOR debts. The debts in the resolution program 
are addressed first. 
The $338 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was settled for $260 in April 2024. The 
payment was completed the same month, and the debt is resolved. (AE D) 
The $1,143 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e was settled for $571 in April 2024. The 
final payment was made in August 2024, and the debt is resolved. (AE D) 
The $5,322 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f was settled for $2,661 in April 2024 with 
monthly payments to the creditor. Applicant’s documentation indicates that as of 
2 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
 
    
     
      
       
  
 
    
 
 
  
  
 
 
       
    
      
 
 
   
  
 
  
 
February 28, 2025, $847 had been paid to the creditor, with $1,813 remaining to be 
paid, at the rate of $139 per month. (AE D) 
The $460 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i was settled for $244 in June 2024. The final 
payment was made in September 2024, and the debt is resolved. (AE D) 
The $886 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j was settled for $399 in March 2024. The final 
payment was made in February 2025, and the debt is resolved. (AE D) 
The $14,024 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o was settled for $4,207 in June 2024 with 
monthly payments to the creditor. Applicant’s documentation indicates that as of March 
28, 2025, $1,402 had been paid to the creditor, with $2,805 remaining to be paid, at the 
rate of $200 per month. (AE D) 
The $417 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.x was settled for $187 in March 2024. The 
payment was completed the same month, and the debt is resolved. (AE D) 
A $384 debt was settled through the program for $200 in March 2024. The final 
payment was made in January 2025, and the debt is resolved. (AE D) This does not 
appear to be a debt that was alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the 
SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be used in assessing 
Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in 
the whole-person analysis. 
Additional debts in the program that have not yet been settled include debts for 
$653 (SOR ¶ 1.d); $2,968 (SOR ¶ 1.g); $751 (SOR ¶ 1.h); $1,000 (SOR ¶ 1.l); $7,064 
(identified as $2,791 past due with a $4,254 balance in SOR ¶ 1.n); $3,885 (SOR ¶ 1.s); 
$1,210 (SOR ¶ 1.t); $967 (SOR ¶ 1.u); $2,675 (SOR ¶ 1.v); $1,552 (SOR ¶ 1.w); $1,485 
(not identified as an SOR debt); and $2,037 (not identified as an SOR debt). (AE D) 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges an auto loan that was $456 past due with a $35,368 balance, 
as listed on the February 2024 credit report. That report indicated the account was 
opened in August 2022. Applicant stated that the loan was paid when he traded that 
vehicle and his wife’s vehicle in for another vehicle. They are down to one vehicle 
between them. (Tr at 41-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2) 
The creditor for the $7,855 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k obtained a judgment and a 
garnishment order against Applicant. As of June 2024, he owed $9,058, plus $9 costs. 
Records indicate that $393 was withheld from his paycheck dated March 14, 2025. The 
remaining balance on the garnishment was $1,414, which means that about $7,653 had 
been garnished from his wages. (AE B, E, F) 
Applicant asserted that the $5,724 debt for a motorcycle (SOR ¶ 1.p) was settled 
and paid on February 5, 2019. In his response to the SOR, he wrote that he was waiting 
for a settlement letter from the creditor. No additional documentation on the debt was 
submitted. The 2017 and 2019 credit reports indicate that the loan was initiated in 2011, 
and it was charged off in 2013. The debt is not listed on the 2023 and 2024 credit

reports, but those reports were obtained long after the seven- year reporting period for 
the debt had ended. (Tr. at 30-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5) 
Applicant asserted that the $521 defaulted loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q was paid 
through a wage garnishment in 2019. He submitted a document that appears to support 
his assertion. Credit reports and Applicant’s document indicate that the loan was taken 
out in January 2015, but there were no payments made between April 2015 and 2019. 
The debt is not listed on the 2023 and 2024 credit reports. (Tr. at 30- 31; Applicant’s 
response to SOR; GE 2-5) 
Applicant did not provide any information about the bank account in collection for 
$647 (SOR ¶ 1.m). The debt is listed on the June 2023 combined credit report by 
TransUnion as assigned in June 2022, with an activity date of June 2023. The debt is 
not listed on the February 2024 Experian credit report. 
Applicant did not provide any information about the satellite television account 
that was in collection for $454 (SOR ¶ 1.r). The debt is listed on the 2017 and 2019 
credit reports with an activity date of May 2014. The debt is not listed on the 2023 and 
2024 credit reports, but those reports were obtained long after the seven- year reporting 
period for the debt had ended. (GE 2-5) 
In May 2024, Applicant agreed to pay a creditor $1,080 over the course of 17 
months. As of January 2025, he had paid $580. I am unable to identify this as an SOR 
debt. (AE G) 
Applicant stated that his finances have improved, and he usually has a few 
hundred dollars left over at the end of the month after his garnishment, payments to the 
debt resolution program, and regular bills. He admitted that he has not yet filed his 2023 
federal and state income tax returns. He stated that he owed the IRS about $4,000 for 
previous tax years, excluding 2023, but he was on a $100 per month payment plan and 
he had paid off two or two and a half years of taxes. He also stated that he was about 
$300 behind on a secured credit card and his military exchange credit card account. 
Neither account was listed as past due on the February 2024 credit report. The secured 
credit card had a balance of $108, and the military exchange credit card had a balance 
of $4,587. (Tr. at 33-41; GE 2) 
Applicant submitted a letter from his manager attesting to his excellent job 
performance and “exceptional character, professionalism, and reliability.” The manager 
added: 
[Applicant’s] trustworthiness and dedication are beyond reproach. In an 
industry where even the smallest mistake can have catastrophic 
consequences, [Applicant] has consistently demonstrated his commitment 
to excellence and safety. I have never once questioned his integrity or his 
ability to carry out his duties with the utmost professionalism and care. (AE

Policies  
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 196 0), as amended; DoD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole -person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness , and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a) inability to satisfy  d
 ebts;  and  
(c) a history of not  m eeting financial obligations.   
Appl
icant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c) are applicable. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
und
er such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast  
doubt  on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good  
judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely   
bey
ond the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss of employment, a business   
downturn, unexpected medical  emergency,  a death, divorce or  separation,  
clear victimization by predatory lending practices,  or identity theft), and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has  received or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem  from a  legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications  that the problem is  
being resolved or is under control;

(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to  
 a good- faith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and  
(e) the individual has  a r easonable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt  which i s  the c ause of the problem  and provides  
documented proof to  substantiate the  basis of the dispute or provides  
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  
Appl
icant’s wife developed a debilitating disease in 2006 and has been unable to 
work. He became the sole provider for his wife and stepchildren, and at times, his 
stepchildren’s children. He had periods of underemployment and unemployment. He 
was laid off from his previous job in December 2019, and when the COVID -19 
pandemic hit, he was unable to find a job until December 2020. Those events were 
beyond his control. For AG ¶ 20 (b) to be applicable, Applicant must establish that he 
acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
The 2009 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a) remains relevant to Applicant’s 
current financial situation because it establishes that he was unable to benefit from the 
fresh start granted by the bankruptcy. However, it no longer has any independent 
security significance. That allegation is mitigated. 
Applicant contracted with a debt resolution company in March 2024. He enrolled 
$49,139 in debt in the company’s program. He has been paying $393 every two weeks 
into an escrow account. As of February 5, 2025, he had paid $8,974, and a number of 
debts have been settled and paid or are being paid. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 
1.e, 1.i, 1.j, 1.x have been settled and paid. These debts are mitigated. The debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.o have been settled and are being paid. These debts are 
also mitigated. 
Applicant stated that the past-due auto loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was paid when 
he traded in the vehicle. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k is being paid by garnishment. 
His assertion that the $5,724 debt for a motorcycle (SOR ¶ 1.p) was settled and paid on 
February 5, 2019, is accepted. The $521 defaulted loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q was paid 
through a wage garnishment in 2019. Those four debts are mitigated. 
Applicant has other SOR and non- SOR debts that have not been resolved, 
either because they have not yet been addressed by the debt resolution company or 
they are not enrolled in the program. 
Had the above been the end of the story, this case might have gone in a 
different direction. Unfortunately, it is not. Applicant has accrued new past -due debts, 
and his taxes are in disarray. He admitted that he has not yet filed his 2023 federal and 
state income tax returns. He stated that he owed the IRS about $4,000 for previous tax 
years, excluding 2023, but he was on a $100 per month payment plan and he had paid 
off two or two and a half years of taxes. It does little good financially to make payments 
on certain debts, while other financial issues, including taxes, continue to arise.

I am bound by AG ¶ 2(b), which requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel 
being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” I find that Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances, and he 
did not make a good- faith effort to pay all his debts. His financial issues are recent and 
ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to 
eliminate concerns about his finances. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent  to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of  
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation  
for the conduct; (8) the potential for  pressure, coercion, exploitation,  or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole- person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s 
honorable military service and his favorable character evidence. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.
