WESLEY, ROGER C. Administrative Judge 
Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, 
Applicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility f or access to 
classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On March 18, 2024, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
Consolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) 
to Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline the 
DCSA CAS could not mak e the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for 
granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified I nformation within Industry (February 20, 1960 ); Department of Defense 
(DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, 
establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a 
Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 25, 2025, and requested that his case 
be resolved on the written record without a hearing . Applicant received the Fie of 
Relevant Material ( FORM) on September 10, 2024, and elected not to respond to the 
FORM. This case was assigned to me on March 3, 2025 . The Government’s case 
consisted of 11 exhibits that were admitted without objection as Items 1-11. 
Summary of Pleadings  
Under Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 12 delinquent consumer 
debts exceeding $43,000, delinquent federal taxes owed in excess of $30,000 for tax 
years 2013, 2016, and 2019 through 2021, and delinquent state taxes owed in excess 
of $887 for tax years 2016, 2020, and 2021. Allegedly, Applicant failed to file his federal 
income tax returns for tax years 2014 -2018 and 2020 and 2023, as required, and his 
state income tax returns for tax years 2012 -2015 and 2019 and 2022, as required. 
Allegedly, Applicant’s delinquent debts and delinquent tax filings have not been 
resolved and remain outstanding. 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted the a llegations with 
explanations and clarifications. He claimed he included all of his delinquent debts in a 
filed bankruptcy. He claimed that he has since filled his federal and state tax returns for 
the years in issue and incorporated his delinquent tax debts in a payment program. He 
provided no documented attachments.

Applicant’s  Finances   
Applicant experienced periods of recurrent unemployment following the C ovid-19 
pandemic and struggled with his debts and overall financial responsibilities. Since 2020, 
Applicant accumulated 12 delinquent consumer debts exceeding $42,000 . Applicant’s 
accumulated consumer debt delinquencies are as follows: 1.a ( credit card debt for 
$7,991); 1.b (a consumer debt for $5,988); 1.c (a credit card debt for $5,869); 1.d (a 
credit card det for $5,448); 1.e (a credit card debt for $2,944); 1.f (a credit card debt for 
$2,951); 1.g (a consumer debt for $1,937); 1.h (a credit card debt for $1,624); 1.i (a 
credit card debt for $1,620); 1.j (a consumer debt for $1,562) ; 1.k a consumer debt for 
$1,364); 1.l (a consumer debt for $987); 1.m (a credit card debt for $816); 1.n (a credit 
card debt for $770); 1.o (a credit card debt $732); and 1.p (a consumer debt for $427). 
(Items 5 -6 and 9-11) Applicant attributed all of his accrued credit card and other 
consumer debts to post -Covid-19 pandemic employment difficulties associated with the 
travel industry. (item 9) 
Additionally, Applicant is of record in failing to file his (a) federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2012 through 2020, as required and (b) his state income tax 
returns for tax years 2012 through 2020, as required. Documented delinquent federal 
income taxes owed for these tax years are as follows: for tax year 2013, the amount 
owed is $762, and for tax years 2016, 2019 -2020, the totaled sum owing is $29,955. 
(Items 9-11) And, he is of record in owing $887 in delinquent income taxes to his state 
of residence for tax years 2016 through 2021, as required. While he did not cite any 
specific reasons for his tax -filing lapses and tax debt accumulations, he acknowledged 
his problems with his tax filing and accrued income tax debts. (Applicant’s response and 
Item 9) 
To address his accrued credit card and other delinquent accounts, Applicant 
petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in July 1991. ( Items 7-8) He received a 
discharge in bankruptcy in October 1991. (Item s 7-8) Bankruptcy records document 
Applicant’s petitioning for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief a second time in December 2002. 
(Item 8) Reportedly, this bankruptcy petition was dismissed. Bankruptcy records further 
confirm that Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 relief for a third time in in October 2005 
and w as discharged in February 2006 .(Item 8) Both of his completed bankruptcies 
appear to be no -asset cases. Neither bankruptcy discharge appears to include any of 
the debts listed in the SOR. 
To date, Applicant has made no documented payment progress in addressing his 
tax and consumer debt delinquencies and tax filing lapses. Any subsequent bankruptcy 
petition he may have file d since his last Chapter discharge in 2006 is neither 
documented no r addressed by Applicant with any specificity. Any installment 
agreements h e may have arranged with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is not 
documented and cannot be assumed without corroboration. In an updated personal 
subject interview (PSI), Applicant told the assigned investigator from the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) that he put off filing his federal and state tax returns for 
the years in issue because he fell behind and could not find the time to complete the m 
during the post -Covid-19 pandemic. (Item 11) While he volunteered his owing late

federal taxes, he acknowledged his consumer debt delinquencies only after being 
confronted by the OPM investigator. (Item 11) 
The developed record is unclear as to how much monthly income Applicant 
currently earns. In the personal financial statement, he provided the OPM investigator in 
his PSI, he reported a net monthly income of $ 7,724, monthly expenses of $ 5,000, and 
a net monthly remainder of $1,233. (Item 11) His cited $400 monthly payments covered 
by his cited IRS installment agreement were neither identified with specificity , provided 
as attachments, nor otherwise corroborated. 
Policies  
By virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by t he U.S. Supreme Court 
in Department of the Navy v. Egan , 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988 ), “no one has a ‘right’ to a 
security clearance.” As Commander in Chief, “the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. ” Egan. at 527. 
Eligibility for access to classified information may only be granted “upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so. ” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge ’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial , and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision -making 
process covering DOHA cases. These guideline s take into account factors that could 
create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as 
considerations that could affect the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. These AGs include conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the 
conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. 
These guidelines must be con sidered before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not 
require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. 
In addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent 
considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in ¶ 2(a) of the AGs, 
which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense 
decision based on a careful consideration of the per tinent guidelines within the context 
of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period 
4 
 
 
                                                                                                                                              
 
 
          
 
 
 
 
                      
of an   applicant’s  life  to  enable  predictive  judgments  to  be  made  about  whether  the  
applicant is an acceptable security risk.  
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s conduct, the  relevant  guidelines are to  be  
considered  together with  the  following  ¶  2(d) factors:  (1) the  nature, extent,  and  
seriousness of the  conduct; (2) the  circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  
knowledgeable participation; (3)  the  frequency and  recency of  the  conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to   which  
participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  and  other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  of the  conduct;  (8) the  potential for  
pressure, coercion,  exploitation, or duress;  and  (9) the  likelihood  of continuation  or  
recurrence.  
Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual 
guidelines are pertinent herein: 
Financial Considerations  
The  Concern:  Failure  or inability to  live  within one’s means, satisfy debts 
and  meet  financial obligations  may indicate  poor self-control,  lack of  
judgment,  or unwillingness to  abide  by rules or regulations,  all  of  which  
can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and  
ability to  protect  classified  or sensitive information.  Financial distress can  
also be  caused  or exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of  
other issues of personnel security concern such  as  excessive  gambling,  
mental health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol abuse  or 
dependence. An  individual who  is financially  overextended  is at greater  
risk of having  to  engage  in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to  
generate  funds.  .  .  .   AG ¶  18.   
  Burdens of Proof  
 
         
   
 
 
     
     
       
     
             
         
   
 
    
         
           
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. 
Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant 
may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions 
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation a bout potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 , Feb. 20, 1960, § 7. See also Exec. 
Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
5 
 
 
                                                                                                                                              
     
     
         
          
      
          
            
   
    
 
 
      
       
         
        
  
 
 
 
 
        
       
 
 
        
        
       
     
    
 
        
         
of establishing  controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan, 484  U.S. at 531.   
“Substantial evidence”  is “more  than  a  scintilla  but less  than  a  preponderance.”   See  v.  
Washington  Metro. Area  Transit Auth., 36  F.3d  375, 380  (4th  Cir. 1994). The  guidelines  
presume  a  nexus or rational connection  between  proven  conduct under any of the  
criteria  listed  therein and  an  applicant’s  security suitability.  See  ISCR Case  No. 95-0611  
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01 -20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis  
Security concerns are raised over Applicant’s accumulation of 12 delinquent 
consumer debts exceeding $ 43,000, federal tax debts exceeding $30,000, and timely 
tax filing failures that raise trust, reliability, and judgment concerns about h is current 
and future ability to manage h is finances safely and respon sibly. These concerns are 
addressed below. 
Financial concerns  
Applicant’s accumulated  delinquent debts warrant the  application  of four of the  
disqualifying  conditions (DC)  of  the  financial consideration  guidelines.  DC ¶¶  19(a),  
“inability to  satisfy  debts”; 19(b),  “unwillingness to  satisfy debts regardless of the  ability 
to  do  so”; 19(c), “a history of not meeting  financial obligations”; and  19(f), “failure to  file  
or fraudulently filing  annual federal, state, or local income  tax returns or failure  to  pay   
annual federal,  state, or local income  tax, as required” apply  to  Applicant’s situation. His  
admitted  debt delinquencies require  no  independent proof to  substantiate  them. See  
Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on  Evidence  §  262 (6th  ed. 2006).  
Applicant’s a dmitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and raise 
judgment issues over the management of h er finances. See ISCR Case No. 03 -01059 
(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). 
Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required 
precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that 
entitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a 
security clearance holder’s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and 
influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. 
Historically, the timing of addressing and resolving of an applicant’s debt 
delinquencies and tax filing lapses (SORs ¶¶ 1.a-1.x) are critical to an assessment of an 
6 
 
 
                                                                                                                                              
 
       
         
            
         
       
      
      
      
       
            
     
  
 
          
       
         
           
      
   
 
       
     
         
      
    
            
      
  
  
 
      
     
        
       
          
        
  
 
            
          
applicant’s trustworthiness, reliability, and   good  judgment in following  rules and   
guidelines necessary for those  seeking  access to  classified  information  or to  holding  a  
sensitive position. See  ISCR  Case  No. 14-06808  at  3  (App. Bd.  Nov.  23. 2016); ISCR  
Case  No.  14-01894  at 5  (App.  Bd. Aug.  18, 2015);  ISCR  Case  No.  14-00221  at  2-5 
(App. Bd. June 29, 2016).  
Without documented evidence of Applicant’s favorably resolving his current debt 
delinquencies and timely tax filing failures, or demonstrated good cause for why these 
debts and timely tax filing failures have not been timely resolved to date , potentially 
available mitigating conditions are limited . Only mitigating condition (MC) 19(b), “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending 
practices, or identity theft), and the individual ac ted responsibly under the 
circumstances,” has limited application. His reported periodic unemployment entitles 
him to only partial application of MC ¶ 19(b) without more information on the current 
status of her debts and his failure to timely resolve his debt delinquencies and timely tax 
filings, as required by law. 
In the past, the Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on 
applicants to provide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial 
problems, whether the issues relate to back taxes or other debts and accounts . See 
ISCR Case No. 19 -02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19 -01599 at 
3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020) . Afforded opportunities to do so, Applicant has provided 
insufficient information on the status of his debts and federal and state tax filings.. 
Applicant’s claimed payment agreements with the IRS and his listed SOR 
creditors, while encouraging if validated , are not accompanied by any document ed 
payment arrangements an d filed tax returns and cannot perforce be accorded much 
probative weight. Applicant’s expressed commitments to address his debts and stabilize 
his finances, while welcomed, without documented validation, represent no more than 
promises to resolve h is still outstanding consumer and tax debts and are not viable 
substitutes for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in 
a responsible way. See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) 
Whole-person assessment  
Whole-person assessment of Applicant’s clearance eligibility requires 
consideration of whether his history of accumulated delinquent debts (both consumer 
and taxes) and tax-filing lapses are fully compatible with minimum standards for holding 
a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his work in the defense 
industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome h is repeated failures or 
inability to address his debts and file his federal and state income tax returns in a timely 
way. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. 
Based on a consideration of all of the facts and circum stances considered in this 
case, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake

 I have  carefully applied  the  law,  as set forth  in Department  of  Navy v. Egan,  484  
U.S. 518  (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the  Directive,  and  the  AGs, to  the  facts and  
circumstances in the  context of the  whole person. I  conclude  financial considerations  
security concerns  are  not mitigated. Eligibility for  access  to  classified  information  is  
denied.   
 
 
        
            
 
 
 
                                
 
                                                            
documented good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government’s financial concerns within 
the foreseeable future. More time is needed for h im to establish the requisite levels of 
stability with h is finances to establish h is overall eligibility for holding a security 
clearance.
