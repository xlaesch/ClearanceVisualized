Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On January 1, 2023, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On October 2, 2024 , the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A, the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 
2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
 
 
 
   
      
  
     
 
 
   
  
  
   
       
 
   
    
   
      
      
          
 
 
   
 
 
   
    
 
     
   
  
  
 
     
  
      
    
       
      
      
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On October 29, 2024, 
and December 2, 2024, Applicant provided his responses to the SOR. On March 5, 2025, 
Department Counsel issued the first amendment to the SOR. On Mar ch 7, 2025 , 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 11, 2025, the case was assigned 
to me. 
On March 13, 2025, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a notice scheduling the hearing on May 6 , 2025. The hearing was held as scheduled 
using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. On April 29, 2025, Department 
Counsel issued the second amendment to the SOR. The first and second SOR 
amendments added three additional alleged delinquent debts to the SOR. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant offered one exhibit into evidence. (Tr. 11, 17-20, 30-31; GEs 1-GE 5; Applicant 
Exhibit (AE A) ) There were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 18, 20, 31) On May 19, 2025, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. Two 
exhibits were received after the hearing, and they were admitted into evidence without 
objection. (AE B; AE C) The record closed on July 8, 2025. (Tr. 54-55, 65) 
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.c, and 1.f through 1.p. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
Applicant denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e because he is making the 
required child-support payments. (HE 3) He did not address the three delinquent debts 
alleged in the two SOR amendments, and no admissions are entered for those three 
alleged debts. 
Applicant is 35 years old, and he has provided security services for a government 
contractor for three years. (Tr. 6, 9, 21; GE 1) In 2008, he graduated from high school , 
and he has about one year of college. (Tr. 6) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 7) 
He was married in 2009 and divorced in January of 2022. (Tr. 7, 21) His current marriage 
was in 2024. (Tr. 7) He has nine children, and they are ages 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 12, 13, 14, 
and 15. (Tr. 7-8) His three youngest children live with Applicant and his current spouse. 
(Tr. 8) The other six children live with h is first spouse. (Tr. 22-23) His current spouse 
started her employment outside their home three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 41) Her 
monthly pay will be about $2,000. (Tr. 41) He does not currently have a security 
clearance. (Tr. 36) He requires a security clearance to retain his current employment. (Tr. 
35)

Financial Considerations   
Applicant’s current salary is $22 an hour. (Tr. 36) His annual gross pay is about 
$44,000, and his monthly take- home pay is about $1,850. (Tr. 36-40) Applicant had 
financial difficulties because of expenses for his divorce, and a substantial part of his 
income goes to his former spouse for child support. (Tr. 37) His hours were reduced 
because he was depressed from the divorce. (Tr. 37) He has less than $10 in his checking 
account; he does not have anything in his savings account; and he does not have a 
401(k)-retirement account. (Tr. 41) He has not received credit counseling, and he does 
not use a monthly budget. (Tr. 42-43) 
Applicant’s SOR and two SOR amendments allege he has 20 delinquent debts 
totaling about $60,000. The debts are substantiated in his credit bureau reports (CBRs). 
Their status is as follows: 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for $10,169. He cosigned on 
a loan to purchase a vehicle with his father. (Tr. 26; GE 5 at 1) The vehicle was stolen, 
and the vehicle insurance was insufficient to repay the loan. (Tr. 26) Applicant and his 
father have not been making payments on the loan. (Tr. 27) Applicant’s last payment was 
in 2019. (Tr. 27) 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $1,776. He said 
he borrowed the funds; he did not contact the creditor; and he did not repay the debt. (Tr. 
47-49; GE 5 at 1-2) 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant has a debt which is past due for $14,816 and has a 
total loan balance of $15,492 . The balance in his March 5, 2025 CBR for this debt is 
$16,168. (GE 5 at 4) The debt was a vehicle loan; the vehicle was totaled in an accident; 
and Applicant’s vehicle insurance had lapsed. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant said he has not made 
any recent payments to address this debt. (Tr. 34) 
SOR ¶ 1 .d  alleges Applicant has  a child -support  debt placed for collection for  
$4,836, and SOR ¶ 1.e  alleges  he  has a charged-off  child-support  debt for $879.  (Tr. 23-
GE 5 at 5, 7)  In  about  2020, his  child support arrearage during the pre-divorce separation  
was  about  $20,000 because he was not  paying child support . (Tr. 38; GE 3 at 2)  The 
balances  in his March 5, 2025 CBR  for the two accounts are  $3,789 and $748, 
respectively.  He pays about $1,500 monthly in child support  automatically from his  
paycheck. (Tr.  24)  
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant has a medical account placed for collection for $652. 
He admitted responsibility for the debt, and he has not done anything to resolve it. (Tr. 
51-52; GE 5 at 6) 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant has a medical account placed for collection for $456. 
He said he believed he paid this debt. (Tr. 55; GE 5 at 8) However, he did not provide any 
documentation showing payment.

SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant has a medical account placed for collection for $1,959. 
He has not made any payments, and he does not have a payment plan. (Tr. 56-57; GE 5 
at 8) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i through 1.m, 1.r, and 1.s allege Applicant has seven medical accounts 
placed for collection by the same collection agent as follows: $1,381; $970; $1,481; 
$2,029; $1,043; $871; and $628, respectively. Applicant admitted his responsibility for 
these medical debts. (Tr. 43- 44; HE 3; GE 4; GE 5 ) He went to the emergency room 
several times because he had COVID-19. (Tr. 45) He does not have a payment plan, and 
he has not made any payments to address these debts. (Tr. 44, 47) 
SOR ¶ 1.n alleges Applicant has an account placed for collection for $5,688. He 
said his apartment had flood damage. (Tr. 53) He complained to the landlord, and the 
landlord did not take prudent or effective measures to stop the flood damage. (Tr. 52-54) 
However, Applicant did not provide documentary evidence that he disputed the debt with 
his landlord, the collection agent, or with any CBRs. 
SOR ¶ 1. o alleges Applicant has an account placed for collection for $170 . 
Applicant wanted to return the Internet connection equipment to a telecommunications 
company; however, the company did not want to accept it. (Tr. 49-50) He disputed his 
responsibility for this debt. (Tr. 50) However, he did not provide any documentation 
showing he disputed the debt with the collection agent or with any CBRs. 
SOR ¶ 1. p alleges Applicant has an account placed for collection for $1,200 . 
Applicant said he resolved this debt in about or before 2019, and it is reported on his CBR 
with a zero balance. (Tr. 50; GE 5 at 4) 
SOR ¶ 1. q alleges Applicant has a past-due debt f or $ 584. He admitted his 
responsibility for this debt. He believed that he paid it, and he could provide 
documentation after the hearing showing payment. (Tr. 51-52; GE 5 at 7) He did not 
provide proof of payment after his hearing. 
SOR ¶ 1.t alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for $8,913. This debt resulted 
from a vehicle loan. (Tr. 27-28) Applicant and his former spouse were responsible for the 
debt. (Tr. 28) The vehicle was repossessed in 2019. (Tr. 28) The judge in his divorce said 
Applicant was not responsible for the debt because his spouse damaged the vehicle 
during their marriage. (Tr. 29) He did not provide a copy of the divorce decree. Applicant 
was unaware that the decision of the divorce court does not excuse his contractual duty 
to pay the creditor. (Tr. 30) On October 18, 2021, the creditor wrote Applicant and thanked 
him for the payment of $800, and the creditor said the loan is now satisfied. (Tr.  A) 
A bankruptcy attorney recommended that Applicant file for a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy 
discharge of his debts. (Tr. 34-35) Applicant did not have the funds to pay the attorney, 
and the bankruptcy process was not started. (Tr. 62) 
The original SOR did not allege any tax issues. Applicant said at his hearing that 
he had not filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2023 and 
4 
 
 
      
      
     
    
   
    
 
 
    
    
 
     
    
     
   
  
   
   
     
 
 
  
 
   
     
   
    
 
 
     
     
 
 
  
  
   
    
 
   
  
  
 
  
   
  
   
2024. (Tr. 57- 60) As a result of this new information, Department Counsel moved to 
amend the SOR for the third time to add an allegation that Applicant had not filed his state 
and federal income tax returns for TYs 2023 and 2024. (Tr. 61) Applicant did not object, 
and I granted the motion to amend the SOR to add SOR allegation 1.u, that is, Applicant 
allegedly failed to file his TYs 2023 and 2024 federal and state income tax returns as of 
the date of his hearing, May 6, 2025. 
Applicant said at his hearing that the tax returns were not filed because he did not 
have the funds to pay the tax -return preparer. (Tr. 58-59) He believe d he would owe 
additional taxes when his tax returns were filed. (Tr. 58-60) 
After his hearing, Applicant provided unsigned and undated federal and state tax 
returns for TYs 2023 and 2024. (AE B; AE C) For TY 2023, his federal income tax return 
indicates adjusted gross income of $59,000 (rounded to nearest $1,000), and federal 
income taxes owed of $4,249. (AE B) His TY 2023 state income tax return indicates he 
should receive a refund of $434. (AE B) For TY 2024 , his federal income tax return 
indicates adjusted gross income for $56 ,000 (rounded to nearest $1,000), and federal 
income taxes owed of $3,806. (AE C ) His TY 2024 state income tax return indicates he 
should receive a refund of $377. (AE C)   
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority “to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance

decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition  by substantial  
evidence,  the burden  shifts to the applicant to rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or  mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶  E3.1.15. An applicant “has  the ultimate burden of  demonstrating that it  
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant  or continue his [or  her] security  
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of  
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at  5 (App. Bd.  Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if  
they  must, on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows:

This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
AG ¶ 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: 
(a) inability to satisfy  d
 ebts;   
(c) a history of not  m eeting financial  obligations; and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
t
ax returns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income tax as  
required.

In ISCR Case No. 08 -12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained the role of CBRs in financial considerations analysis: 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).  
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. The 
financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 which may be applicable in 
this case are as follows: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  
 so infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  pr oblem were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has  received or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- f aith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;     
(e) the individual has  a r easonable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue; and  
(g) the individual has  m ade arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
The 
Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).

AG ¶ 20(a) does  not apply to the SOR debts. “It is also well established that  an  
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts  demonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can  
be viewed as recent for purposes of  the Guideline F  mitigating conditions.” ISCR 22-
02226 at  2 (App.  Bd.  Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No.  15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.  
16, 2017)).  
Applicant has nine children, and he is paying $1,500 monthly to support six of his 
children who live with his former spouse. The SOR lists eight medical debts. Divorce, 
underemployment, and medical debts are circumstances largely beyond his control, 
which adversely affected his finances. However, “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] financial 
difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] 
control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the applicant] has since 
acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case 
No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007). The DOHA Appeal Board has said: 
[A]n applicant  must act responsibly given his or her circumstances and  
develop a reasonable plan for repayment,  accompanied by concomitant  
conduct even if it may  only provide for the payment of  debts one at  a time.  
ISCR Case No. 07 -06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21 , 2008). What  constitutes  
responsible behavior  depends on the facts  of  a given case and the fact that  
an applicant’s debts will not  be paid off  for a long time, in and of itself, may  
be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. 09- 08462 at 4. Relevant  to  
the equation is an assessment  as to whether  an applicant acted responsibly  
given  [his or] her limited resources  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at  3-
4 (App. Bd. Oct.  29, 2009).  
ADP Case No. 23- 00547 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2024). A component is whether he 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. Applicant did not describe in sufficient detail how the circumstances beyond 
his control affected his finances. He did not provide a detailed budget or provide 
documentation showing payments to 15 SOR creditors. He did not provide 
correspondence from or to the creditors showing he maintained contact with 15 of them. 
He did not prove that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges  he has  20  delinquent debts totaling about $60,000 . “[A]  
single debt can be sufficient to raise Guideline F security concerns.” ISCR Case No. 19-
02667 at  3 (App.  Bd.  Nov. 3, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-05366 at 3 (App. Bd.  Feb.  
5, 2016)). “Additionally, a single debt that remains unpaid over a period of years can  
properly be characterized as a history of not  meeting financial obligations.”  Id.  
Applicant is credited with mitigating the following five SOR debts:  1.d  ($4,836), 1.e  
($879), 1.o  ($170), 1.p  ($1,200), and 1.t  ($8,913).  He  has been making his  $1,500 monthly  
child-support  payments  out of his  salary, which has  been gradually reducing his  child-
support  arrearage.  His child-support payments are sufficient to  mitigate SOR ¶¶ 1.d and  
1.e. He disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($170);  however,  he did not  provide documentation  
showing his basis for the dispute.  This debt for $170 is  of minimal  magnitude, and it is  
mitigated  without documentation.  His CBR shows the debt in SOR ¶  1.p ($1,200) is paid,

and  he said he paid it  around 2019. He  paid $800 in 2021 and settled the debt in SOR  ¶  
1.t ( $8,913).  Of the 20 SOR debts,  the only debt s  with payments in the previous  12  
months  are his child-support debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.  
Applicant’s tax preparer provided copies of Applicant’s TYs 2023 and 2024 federal 
and state income tax returns to Applicant on May 10, 2025, and I have credited Applicant 
with filing them shortly thereafter. AG ¶ 20(g) mitigates the late filing of his tax returns. 
Applicant failed to show that he timely paid in full his federal income taxes for TYs 
2023 and 2024. This conduct was not alleged in the SOR. He said at his hearing that he 
did not have the funds to pay any additional debts , and he did not provide any 
documentation showing payment of his federal income taxes for TYs 2023 and 2024. This 
federal income tax debt will not be considered for disqualification purposes; however, it 
will be considered: “(a) in assessing [his] credibility; (b) in evaluating [his] evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether [he] has 
demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole- person concept.” 
ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022) (citing ISCR Case No. 15- 07369 
at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). 
The Appeal Board has previously stated that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect 
an applicant to present documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve debts. ISCR 
Case No. 19-03757 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 
(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020)). Applicant did not provide enough details about what he did to 
address his SOR debts over the previous 12 months. He did not provide documentation 
relating to 15 of his SOR debts showing: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account 
statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or 
made any payments to the creditors; (2) correspondence to or from the creditors to 
establish maintenance of contact; (3) correspondence to creditors or CBRs showing 
credible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and 
why he held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, 
such as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve his 
delinquent debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed to 
establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(e) because he did not provide documented proof to 
substantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes related to the 15 
unmitigated SOR debts. 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to the 15 unmitigated debts. “[U]ntil an 
applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as a matter of law that 
he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts. 
The phrase ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of actual debt 
reduction through payment on debts.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 05 -01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007)). There is no documentation 
establishing that Applicant is working to establish payment plans to address 15 of his 
SOR debts. I am not confident that he will establish payment plans, pay, or otherwise 
resolve any of the 15 unmitigated SOR debts, and maintain his financial responsibility. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.

Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is 35 years old, and he has provided security services for a government 
contractor for three years. In 2008, he graduated from high school, and he has about one 
year of college. He was married in 2009 and divorced in January of 2022. His current 
marriage was in 2024. He has nine children. The three youngest children live with 
Applicant and his spouse. The other six children live with his first spouse. His current 
spouse started her employment outside their home three weeks before his hearing. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations analysis section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the 
evidence of mitigation. He did not establish that he was unable to make more timely and 
significant progress resolving his SOR debts. The financial evidence raises unmitigated 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. 
See AG ¶ 18. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards documented resolution of his debts and maintenance of his 
financial responsibility, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns.
