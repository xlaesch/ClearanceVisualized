Decision 
HEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. National 
security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
History of the Case  
On May 29, 2024, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) alleging secur ity concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Item 1) The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (D OD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
On June 6, 2024, Applicant submitted an answer, with documentation, to the SOR 
and requested a decision based upon the administrative record (Answer). (Item 1) A copy 
of the file of relevant material (FORM), was provided to Applicant by letter dated July 31, 
2024. Department Counsel attached as evidence to the FORM Items 1 through 6. 
Applicant received the FORM on August 29, 2024, and was afforded a period of 30 days 
to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She 
responded in a timely manner and provided 62 pages of documentation . On November

12,  2024,  the  case  was assigned  to  me.  I  marked  Applicant’s documents as follows: AE  
A: Undated  Personal Statement (3 pages); AE  B: Screenshots of  Text Messages and  
Documents  (1 page);  AE  C: Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS) Wage  and  Income  
Transcripts for Tax  Years (TY) 2017  through  2023  (58  pages). Neither party made  
objections to  the  proffered  documents;  therefore, Items 1  through  6  and  AE  A  through  C  
are admitted into  evidence.  
 
       
        
        
        
Findings of Fact  
Applicant, 32, has never married and has no children . She attended college from 
2010 to 2017 but is two elective courses short of a degree . She worked for her current 
employer, a federal contracting company since March 2023. In September 2023, she was 
promoted from shift lead to supervisor. This is her first security clearance application . 
(Items 1-3, AE A) 
The SOR alleged Applicant has 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately 
$41,627. She admitted the debts but qualified her responses with statements regarding 
their status. Her financial struggles and each of the debts are addressed in detail below. 
(Items 1-3; AE A) 
Applicant left  college  in  2017, she  worked  to  support herself during  her last few  
years of college, paying  her tuition  and  living  expenses  herself. After  2017, she  struggled  
financially due  to  low-wage  positions,  and  she  was unemployed  during  the  following  
periods: 5/19-7/19; 4/20  to  8/20; 2/21  to  8/21; 3/22  to  5/22; 2/23  to  3/23. She  was  
unemployment because  of  the  Covid-19  Pandemic, contract work ending,  and  waiting  for  
her current position to start. She  was supported  financially by her parents, grandmother,  
and  savings. Additionally, since  2017, she  held 11  different jobs, often  working  multiple  
jobs at the  same  time.  Her lack of income, multiple  jobs in a  calendar year, and  
unemployment compensation  is reflected  in the  IRS  documents  she  provided. (Items 1-
3;  AE A; AE C)  
After Applicant’s 2019 period of unemployment, she withdrew over $4,000 from a 
retirement account. Unfortunately, she fell behind on bills, despite finding a second job in 
August 2019 and occasionally driving for a ride -share business. She was evicted in 
January 2020 from the apartment listed below and then lived in her car until March 2020. 
She subsequently lost this server position in April 2020 due to the Covid -19 Pandemic. 
(Items 1-3; AE A; AE C) 
SOR ¶  1.a:  $7,252  account  for an  apartment lease  was placed  for  collection  in  
February 2020. Applicant provided  proof of a  $1,813.24  payment,  representing  25%  of  
the  debt, and  she  set up  automatic-recurring  bi-weekly payments for the  remaining  
balance. (Item 1 at 5-6, 11;  Item  4 at 2; Item  5 at 2; Item 6 at 1; AE  A)  
SOR ¶  1.b: $4,230 account for a charged-off car loan that became delinquent in 
2018. Applicant made a $1,000 payment from her checking account and set up automatic-
recurring payments of an unstated amount for the remaining balance . In the July 2024 
credit bureau report ( CBR), the account balance was $2,249, reflecting she made

additional payments. She asserted this account balance was $0 in her FORM response. 
(Item 1 at 6, 12; Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 1; AE A) 
SOR ¶¶  1.c:  $3,064 and 1.d $1,023 are credit-card accounts, with the same 
creditor, placed for collection in July 2021 and April 2021, respectively. Applicant resolved 
the debts prior to submitting her Answer . Neither debt appears on the July 2024 CBR. 
(Item 1 at 16-7, 13-14; Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2-3; AE A) 
SOR ¶  1.e: $925 is a credit -card account placed for collection in May 2020 . 
Applicant provided documentation reflecting the account had a $0 balance, and it was 
resolved through garnishment prior to June 2024 . She was working overseas and sent 
her mother $1,000 to pay the debt in March 2024; however, it was garnished before she 
could actively pay it. (Item 1 at 7, 15; Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 1; AE A; AE B) 
SOR ¶  1.f: $673 is a credit -card account placed for collection in October 2019 . 
Applicant paid it in full on June 7, 2024. (Item 1 at 8, 16; Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 
at 2; AE A) 
SOR ¶  1.g:  $266 is an insurance account for insurance placed for collection in 
September 2018. Applicant paid the debt in full on June 7, 2024. (Item 1 at 8, 17; Item 4 
at 4; Item 5 at 3; AE A) 
SOR ¶¶  1.h: $17,714 and 1.i: $4,953 are private student-loan accounts placed for 
collection in 2019. Applicant provided documentation reflecting that on June 5, 2025, she 
agreed to preauthorized-recurring monthly payments of $200. Starting on July 15, 2024, 
this money is to be deducted from her checking account and applied toward both debts. 
(Item 1 at 8-9, 18; Item 4 at 2-3; AE A) 
SOR ¶¶  1.j: $280 and 1.k: $247 are medical debt s placed for collection in 
November 2018 and February 2019, respectively. Applicant paid both debts in full on May 
31 and June 3, 2024. (Item I at 9-10, 19, 20; Item 4 at 4, 5; AE A) 
Applicant is attending counseling to “address any underlying issues that may have 
contributed to [her] financial struggles.” Aside from the debts alleged in the SOR, 
Applicant’s other consumer-credit accounts are in good standing. (Item 6; AE A) 
Policies  
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
3 
 
 
 
        
     
       
         
 
 
      
    
         
       
 
 
       
      
       
      
      
 
           
       
    
              
      
       
         
 
 
         
           
      
 
 
   
        
 
    
        
       
     
       
 
 
   
 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in mak ing a 
decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified inform ation. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F: Financial Considerations  
Failure to meet one’s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
or sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk 
of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG ¶ 18) 
The record establishes the Government’s prima facie case Applicant owed seven 
delinquent consumer accounts, totaling $ 16,433, two private student loans, totaling 
$22,667, and two medical debts, totaling $ 527. The following financial considerations 
disqualifying conditions apply: 
AG ¶  19(a) an inability to satisfy debts; and

__________________________ 
AG ¶  19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
Applicant incurred delinquent debt in the years after she left college without a 
degree. Between 2017 and March 2023, she held 11 different jobs, often working more 
than one at a time and suffered chronic underemployment and periods of unemployment. 
Many of these events were beyond her control. Given the length of time she left her 
finances unattended, her actions to resolve her delinquent account cannot be considered 
as acting responsibly under the circumstances. As a result, AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
However, her actions merit the application of AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated and is 
adhering to a good -faith effort to repay h er creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” After 
receiving the SOR, she has made a good-faith effort to repay her creditors. She resolved 
the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1. b through 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k, between March 2024 and 
August 2024. Additionally, she paid $1,813 or 25% of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and 
established a payment plan to resolve the balance of this account by February 2025 
through automatic -recurring payments. Finally, s he established a payment plan to 
rehabilitate her delinquent student loans. Her actions are sufficient to mitigate the financial 
concerns alleged in the SOR. 
Based on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant’s suitability for access 
to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered the whole -person 
factors at AG ¶ 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection proceedings. 
Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make “an examination of a sufficient period 
of a person’s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable 
security risk.” Furthermore, applicants are not held to a standard of perfection. Applicant 
experienced difficulties after leaving college without a degree, including unemployment 
and homelessness . She responded appropriately to the SOR and addressed the 
government’s concerns. She is otherwise financially healthy , and there are no o ther 
security concerns related to her finances. 
Formal Findings  
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F: FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs  1.a  –  1.k:  For Applicant 
Conclusion 
I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the 
United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
