Decision  
GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate all of the financial considerations security concerns . 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On April 12, 2024, the Department of Defense (DOD ) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ) 
implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. 
Applicant submitted a response to the SOR on April 30, 2024 (Answer) and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
January 13, 2025. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
on January 22, 2025, scheduling the matter for a hearing on February 4, 2025. I convened 
the hearing as scheduled. 
I admitted in evidence without objection Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 and 
Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. Applicant testified and called one witness, his

spouse. I granted Department Counsel’s motion at the hearing to amend the SOR to 
conform to the evidence, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.17 of the Directive, by adding an allegation 
under Guideline F, numbered as SOR ¶ 1.f, as follows: “You are indebted to the federal 
government in the approximate amount of $10,000 for unpaid taxes. As of February 4, 
2025, the taxes remain unpaid.” In turn, I granted Applicant’s request for additional time 
to prepare his response to SOR ¶ 1.f. At Applicant’s request, I also kept the record open 
until February 18, 2025, to allow him the opportunity to submit additional documentation. 
DOHA issued a nother notice on February 5, 2025, scheduling the matter for a 
second hearing on February 24, 2025. I convened the second hearing as scheduled. I 
admitted in evidence without objection AE G. I also kept the record open until March 10, 
2025, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation. He did not 
do so and the record closed on that date. DOHA received the transcript of the first hearing 
on February 19, 2025 (Tr. 1), and of the second hearing on March 7, 2025 (Tr. 2). 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant denied the allegations numbered as SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.e in his Answer, and 
he denied SOR ¶ 1.f at both hearings. 
Applicant is 54 years old. He was born in Ghana and immigrated to the United 
States in 1999. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. He is married and he has 
two children, ages 15 and 12. (Tr. 1 at 10, 94, 120, 122-130; GE 1) 
Applicant obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1998 from a university in Nigeria. From 
around 2000 to 2013, he took courses in a master’s program at a university in the United 
States but he did not earn a master’s degree. He has also earned various certifications. 
He has primarily worked for various DOD contractors since approximately 2011. He held 
only part-time employment from October 2015 to October 2017 and from September 2019 
to November 2019 . H e was also unemployed from December 2018 to August 2019, 
December 2019 to November 2021, and October 2022 to February 2024. Since February 
2024, he has worked part time as a driver for a food-delivery service company. In 2024, 
he applied for employment with a DOD contracting company that was sponsoring him for 
a security clearance, and the company’s offer of employment was contingent on him 
obtaining a clearance. He was first granted a clearance in approximately 2018. (Tr. 1 at 
5-8, 10-11, 29-43, 48-50, 67-68, 78-80, 82-83, 85-86, 93-99; GE 1-2) 
The SOR alleges Applicant has five delinquent consumer debts totaling 
approximately $28,507 and he owed $10,000 in federal income taxes . His delinquent 
debts are established by his admissions during his August 2022 background interview 
and April 2024 response to interrogatories, and by credit bureau reports (CBR s) from 
November 2021 and November 2023. (GE 2-4) His outstanding taxes are established by 
his admissions during both hearings and by an excerpt of an Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) tax account transcript. His July 2024 CBR reflects a freeze had been placed on his 
credit report and no delinquent debts are reported on his February 2025 CBR. (GE 5; AE 
A)

Applicant and his spouse attribute Applicant’s financial issues primarily to his 
periods of underemployment and unemployment, as previously discussed. Although he 
received approximately $10,000 in unemployment benefits over five to six months in early 
2021, he was otherwise primarily supported by his spouse during these periods. He used 
credit cards to pay for living expenses. Since 2023, his spouse was unemployed and 
receiving disability benefits due to her recent involvement in an on-the-job accident. (Tr. 
1 at 19, 33-43, 47-50, 55-56, 58, 60-61, 63-68, 72-74, 78-82, 93, 97-121; GE 2) 
Applicant resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, a charged-off credit card for $1,221, in 
August 2022. He testified he settled the debt for $300. The November 2023 CBR reflects 
this debt carries a zero balance and not es it was “settled for less than full balance.” (Tr. 
1 at 19, 45-46, 59, 62, 74-76, 115; GE 2, 4; AE G) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c are credit cards with the same creditor, placed for collection 
with the same collection agency , in the approximate amounts of $9,836 and $6,138, 
respectively. Applicant indicated during his background interview that he contacted the 
collection agency to make payment arrangements, but it wanted more than he was able 
to pay. He stated in his Answer that he again attempted to contact the collection agency 
but various entities were purporting to own these debts so he did not make any payments 
because he was unsure if these were fraudulent companies. He did not understand at the 
time that his debts could be sold to different companies for collection attempts. (Tr. 1 at 
43-64, 100-101, 113; GE 2-4; AE G) 
Applicant  provided documentation  reflecting he entered a payment arrangement  
with a law firm  in April 2024 to resolve SOR ¶  1.c through  an initial payment of $100 due  
that month,  followed by 46  monthly payments of $210. He did not provide documentation  
to show  he made any  payments in accordance with that arrangement.  He stated he did  
not make payments toward these debts because he did not  have the financial means to  
do so,  but  he intends  to pay them.  These debts remain unresolved.  (Tr. 1 at 43-64, 100-
101, 113; GE 2-4; AE G)   
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d is an overdraft account and a credit card with the same 
creditor, placed for collection with the same collection agency, in the approximate 
amounts of $6,764 and $4,548, respectively. Applicant indicated during his background 
interview that he did not contact the creditor for these debts because he believed they 
had both fallen off his CBRs. He testified that an attorney contacted him on behalf of the 
creditor. In August 2022, he entered an agreement to settle both debts for $9,099, through 
an initial, one-time payment of $100 that same month, followed by monthly payments of 
$165. He stated in his Answer he was resolving both debts through a monthly payment 
plan of $100, and he testified he made payments totaling approximately $700 to $800 but 
stopped doing so when he became unemployed. He intends to resume payments once 
he has the financial means to do so. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his 
claims of payment toward these debts and they remain unresolved. (Tr. 1 at 19, 45 -46, 
53-54, 61-62, 65-74, 100-101, 115; GE 2-4; AE G) 
Applicant acknowledged he owed between $8,000 and $10,000 in federal income 
taxes, which he believed he incurred during his period of employment from approximately 
2015 to 2016 because his employer did not deduct taxes from his pay. He stated he made

around two to three payments of $350 toward his outstanding taxes and he asked the 
IRS for a deferment due to his unemployment and underemployment. He understood his 
legal obligation to timely file and pay his income tax returns and taxes . He provided an 
incomplete IRS tax account transcript reflecting he made two payments of $250 in 
September 2018 and October 2018, but he did not provide any further documentation. A 
January 2020 entry on the transcript reflects, “Balance due account currently not 
collectible - due to hardship.” The transcript also reflects that interest and penalties for 
late payment of his taxes have continued to accrue, with such charges being assessed in 
2020, 2021, and 2022. (Tr. 1 at 83-110; Tr. 2 at 5-9; AE G) 
As of the date of the  hearing,  Applicant earned  approximately $1,500 to 2,000 
monthly  as a driver for a food- delivery service  company  and hi s spouse received 
approximately $4, 800 monthly in disability pay.  During  his background interview , he 
indicated he earned approximately  $140,000 annually and his spouse  earned $105,000  
annually. He has never received financial counseling, but his bank offered him  such  
counseling in approximately 2024. He  stated he keeps a budget  and  he described his  
financial situation as “bad.” (Tr.  1 at  81)  Various  family members  have entrusted him  with  
their  money. He received a certificate of appreciate in recognition of his outstanding  
leadership and commitment to his church.  (Tr. 1 at 26-27, 62-63, 76-110, 115-119, 121-
130; Tr.  2 at  7-8;  GE 2; AE B,  C,  D,  E)  
Policies  
When evaluating an applicant ’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national 
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship

transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of “compromise of classified information. Section 7 of E xec. Or. 
10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall 
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also 
Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or 
sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F:  Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambl ing, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overe xtended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a) inability to satisfy  debts;  
(c
) a history of not  mee ting financial  obligations; and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax r
eturns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income tax as  
required.  
Applic
ant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. He has also failed to 
pay approximately $10,000 in federal income tax es. AG ¶¶ 19 (a), 19(c), and 19(f) are 
established. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable: 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
     
        
 
       
    
   
   
   
    
     
    
   
      
   
 
 
  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,  wa
 s so infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  probl em were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem  from a  legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue;  and  
(g) the individual has  mad e arrangements  with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
Condit
ions beyond Applicant’s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), he must provide evidence that 
he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He paid SOR ¶ 1.e in 2022 before the 
issuance of the SOR and I find that allegation in his favor under AG ¶ 20(b). 
Applicant has not made any payments toward the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c and 
he has not provided any documentation to support his claims that fraudulent companies 
were purporting to own these debts. He also did not provide documentation to corroborate 
his claims of payment toward the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. Although his outstanding 
taxes are reflected as not collectible as of January 2020, his last two payments toward 
them occurred in 2018, they remain unpaid, and interest and penalties have continued to 
accrue on them. He has not received financial counseling and he acknowledged that his 
financial situation is bad. He needs more time to establish he has his finances under 
control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) do not 
apply except as noted above. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s

conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which  participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-
person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate all of the financial considerations security concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
