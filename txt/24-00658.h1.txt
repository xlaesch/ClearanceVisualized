Decision 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant has not provided evidence sufficient to mitigate the national security 
concern arising from his delay in filing his federal and state income tax returns for tax 
years 2018 through 2022 and his failure to pay timely $5, 437 of federal income taxes . 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
Applicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on April 4, 2023. The 
Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 
23, 2024, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The 
DOD acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines, effective within the DOD as of June 8, 2017. 
Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR (Answer) on August 8, 2024 and 
elected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). Department Counsel submitted the Government’s file

of relevant material (FORM) on September 4, 2024 , including documents identified as 
Items 1 through 6. He received it on September 17, 2024. He was afforded 30 days after 
receiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the Answer are the 
pleadings in the case. (Items 1S and 1A, respectively .) Items 2 through 6 are admitted 
without objection. The case was assigned to me on December 6, 2024. 
Findings of Fact  
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make 
the following findings of fact: 
Applicant is 39 years old, never married , and has no children. He earned his 
bachelor’s degree in May 2009. He reported two periods of unemployment. The first was 
from December 2012 to June 2014, after his employer was bought out. The second was 
from June 2020 to March 2021, after he was laid off due to COVID. Since February 2023, 
he has worked for a defense contractor. This is his first trip through the national security 
clearance process. (Item 2.) 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (a) failed to file federal income 
tax returns for the tax years 2018 through 2022 and; (b) failed to pay delinquent federal 
income taxes of $5,437. (Item 1S ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.) He admitted those allegations and 
stated that the returns for those tax years have been filed and that his current tax debt is 
$5,063 which he makes payments on every month. (Item 1A ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.) He did not 
provide any documents evidencing those filings or those payments. 
Also under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file state income 
tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2022. (Item 1S ¶ 1.c.) He admitted that allegation 
and stated that the returns for those tax years are now currently filed. (Item 1A ¶ 1.c.) He 
did not provide any documents evidencing those filings. 
In his SCA, for 2020 taxes, Applicant said: ‘I lost my job didn’t have the funds to 
pay because I had to take out of retirement.” For 2021, he said: “Working to pay all years 
together. In the process of filing all taxes as we speak.” For 2022 he sai d: “Didn’t have 
the funds working on paying taxes now [sic]. I am working on filing these taxes.” (Item 2 
at 34-35.) He also reported in his SCA that from September 2021 to October 2021 , he 
traveled to a foreign country and spent six to ten days for tourism. (Item 2 at 25-26.) 
In Applicant’s August 10, 2023 responses to interrogatories, he explained why he 
failed to file or pay his 2020 through 2022 state tax returns: “I didn’t file the taxes due to 
lost my job. I was laid off due to covid and didn’t have the finances at the time to pay the 
taxes and had to take full unemployment amount without any taxes being taken out which 
put me at a deficit .” (Emphasis added.) He attached his “Employer W2 Information” for 
2019 through 2022. (Item 3 at 2, 8-11.) The interrogatories requested that he provide 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax Account Transcripts for tax years 2020 through 2022. 
They also provided instructions on how to obtain those Transcripts an d enclosed IRS

Form 4506-T for that purpose. He did not provide the Transcripts requested. Instead, he 
included a blank Form 4506-T with his responses. (Item 3 at 2, 5-7.) 
In his February 9, 2024 responses to interrogatories, he explained why he failed 
to file or pay his 2020 through 2022 state taxes: “I didn’t file the taxes due to lost my job. 
I was laid off and didn’t have the finances at the time to pay the taxes. I had financial strife 
during the covid years. All taxes for those years have now been filed with H&R Block.” 
He attached his “Employer W2 Information” for 2020 and 2021. (Item 4 at 2-3, 8-10.) The 
interrogatories requested that he provide IRS Tax Account Transcripts for tax years 2020 
through 2022. They also provided instructions on how to obtain those Transcripts and 
enclosed IRS Form 4506-T for that purpose. He did not provide the Transcripts requested. 
Instead, he included a blank Form 4506-T with his responses. (Item 4 at 2, 5-7.) 
In Applicant’s verified personal subject interview (PSI) conducted on May 24, 2023, 
he was asked who paid for his travel abroad for tourism in September 2021, if he did not 
have enough money to pay his taxes, The summary reported: He made the decision to 
use his money towards traveling instead of filing and paying his taxes with the plan to get 
to his taxes later. (Item 5 at 3.) The interrogatories requested that he provide IRS Tax 
Account Transcripts for tax years 2019 through 2022. They also provided instructions on 
how to obtain those Transcripts . He did not provide the Transcripts requested. He 
attached his “Employer W2 Information” for 2019 through 2022. (Item 5 at 8, 12-14.) 
In  response  to  the  same  interrogatories,  Applicant’s table  showed  his federal  and  
state  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2019  through  2021  were  filed  years late,  in 2023  and  2024. 
His 2022  returns  were  filed  only three  days late. (Item  5  at 8-9.) His Personal Financial  
Statement (PFS)  (all  amounts are monthly)  is inaccurate. He listed  his Gross Salary as  
$3,203.46  and  Total Deductions of $180.96. That yields  $3,022.50  of Total  Income. But  
he arrived  at $4,386.08  as his Total Income.  All  subsequent  calculations are based  on  
this inaccurate Total Income. (Item  5 at 11.)  
Law and Policies 
It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the 
Supreme Court held, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, an 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are 
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the 
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
¶2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national 
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”

Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, then the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. 
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out 
in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to  live  within  one's means, satisfy debts, and  meet financial  
obligations may indicate  poor self-control, lack of judgment,  or  
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise  
questions about an  individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and  ability to  
protect  classified  or  sensitive information.  Financial distress can  also be  
caused  or  exacerbated  by, and  thus can  be  a  possible  indicator of,  other  
issues of  personnel security concern  such  as  excessive gambling, mental  
health  conditions, substance  misuse, or alcohol abuse  or dependence. An  
individual who  is financially overextended  is at greater risk of having  to  
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to  generate funds. . . .   
This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
Guideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19. 
The following condition is the only one applicable in this case: 
(f)   failure to  file   .  .  .  annual Federal,  state,  or local income  tax returns  .  . .   
or failure to  pay  annual Federal, state, or local income tax  as required.  
The  SOR’s  alleged  unfiled  federal  and  state  income  tax returns  and  Applicant’s  
failure to  pay federal income  taxes, are established  by Applicant’s admissions. AG ¶19   
(f) applies. The  next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  
Guideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising 
from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
(a)  the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent, or occurred  
under such  circumstances that  it  is unlikely to  recur  and  does not  cast

doubt on  the  individual’s current   reliability,  trustworthiness,  or good   
judgment;   
(b)  the  conditions that  resulted  in  the  financial problem were  largely beyond  
the  person’s control (e.g.,  . . . loss of employment  . . .), and the  individual  
acted responsibly under the circumstances); and  
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
I have considered mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a). Applicant’s federal and state 
income tax failures to file returns began with his 2018 returns, that is , in calendar year 
2019. Those late filings continued until he belatedly filed his returns in 2023 and 2024. 
His failures to file did not occur that long ago. And they did recur. His financial inability to 
pay any taxes due does not excuse his failures to file returns. In addition, he only filed 
those returns after his SCA was submitted in April 2023. That undercuts the weight such 
untimely filings might otherwise merit. ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 
2017). Finally, in three sets of interrogatories, he was requested for his relevant IRS Tax 
Transcripts. He was given express instructions on how to obtain those Transcripts. Yet 
he did not provide those Transcripts. His failures to file timely his federal and state income 
tax returns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20(a). 
As to Applicant’s delinquent federal income taxes, I have considered mitigating 
conditions AG ¶¶ 20(b) and (g). AG ¶ 20(b) first requires that Applicant be confronted by 
circumstances that “were largely beyond [his] control.” His loss of employment satisfies 
that requirement. The next requirement is that he have “acted responsibly” in addressing 
his loss of employment as it affected his federal income tax liability. He claimed that: (1) 
his debt is somewhat less than alleged in the SOR, and that; (2) he makes payments on 
that debt every month. He did not, however, provide any documentation evidencing that 
payment arrangement with the IRS or that he is in compliance with it. The Appeal Board 
has consistently required applicants to provide documentation evidencing actions taken 
to resolve financial problems, whether the issues are back taxes or other debts. See ISCR 
Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). His delinquent federal income tax liability is not mitigated by AG ¶¶ 
20(b) and (g). 
Whole Person Concept  
Under AG ¶ 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶¶ 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) 
(explaining the “whole-person” concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered 
the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole -person concept in 
light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

_____________________________ 
Applicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to 
mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial consideratio ns. I find 
against Applicant on SOR ¶ 1. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.c: Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified 
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
