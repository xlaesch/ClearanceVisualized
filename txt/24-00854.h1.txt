Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant mitigated security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence); 
however, he failed to mitigate Guideline F (financial considerations ) security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the  Case  
On April 7, 2023, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (GE 1) On July 
22, 2024, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), 
issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive O rder (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classifie d I nformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
 
 
 
   
       
 
 
  
  
     
 
   
 
   
     
        
 
    
     
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
     
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F and B. (HE 
2) 
Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested a hearing. (HE 3) On 
January 15, 2025, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On February 21, 2025, the 
case was assigned to me. On February 26, 2025, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for April 21, 2025. (HE 1) 
Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. 
Department Counsel provided five exhibits, and Applicant did not provide any 
exhibits at his hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 17; GE 1-GE 5) There were no objections, and all 
exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 18) The transcript was received on May 1, 2025. 
Applicant provided 10 exhibits after his hearing, which were all admitted without objection. 
(Applicant Exhibit (AE) A -AE K) The exhibits included spellings of the names of his 
siblings and some corrections to the transcript. (AE C; AE K) The record closed on May 
27, 2025. (Tr. 70, 77) 
Legal Issues  
Department Counsel requested administrative notice concerning Somalia. (Tr. 17-
18; HE  5) Applicant  did not object,  and  I granted Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 18)  
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative  
proceedings.  See  ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at  2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case  
No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at  2 (App. Bd.  
Oct.  12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.  02-18668 at 3 (App.  Bd.  Feb. 10,  2004) and  McLeod 
v.  Immigration and Naturalization Service,  802 F.2d 89, 93 n.  4 (3d  Cir. 1986)). Usually,  
administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known  
or from government reports.  See  Stein, Administrative Law, Section  25.01 (Bender  & Co.  
2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for  administrative notice).   
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all the SOR allegations, except he did 
not admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.i. (HE 3) He also provided explanations, clarifications, and 
mitigating information. (Id.) 
Applicant is a 59- year-old linguist, and he is seeking employment with a U.S. 
Government contractor. (Tr. 29) He worked for the U.S. Government as a linguist from 
1993 to 1994, and in 2023. H e held a security clearance or interim security clearance 
during those years. (Tr. 52) He has a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 27) 
Applicant has worked as a translator or interpreter for 15 years. (Tr. 29) In 2023, he was 
working for the U.S. Government in Somalia, and he had to return to the United States 
2 
 
 
   
  
 
 
   
   
 
    
  
    
     
     
 
 
 
  
     
 
 
      
     
    
   
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
   
    
   
because of an illness. (Tr. 29) He currently is a self-employed or independent contractor, 
and he works as driver for a large company. (Tr. 39) 
Financial Considerations  
Applicant first started to have financial problems in 2018. (Tr. 30) He also fell 
behind on some of his taxes because of the COVID -19 pandemic. (Tr. 30) In 2023, 
Applicant had a serious illness; he returned to the United States from Somalia; and he 
was unable to work for eight or nine months. (Tr. 29, 42) When he was ready to return to 
Somalia, he was advised his security clearance was on hold. (Tr. 42) He remained in the 
United States, and his income did not increase to the same levels he was receiving as a 
linguist in Somalia. His current monthly income averages about $4,000. (Tr. 39) If he is 
hired as a linguist, he expects to receive annual income of about $110,000. (Tr. 41) 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file, as required, a federal income tax return  
for the tax year (TY)  2018. Applicant said he completed his tax return and expected that  
his spouse would file it. (Tr. 20) His  IRS tax  transcript shows he filed his TY  2018 federal  
income tax return on April 23,  2019,  and it was processed on June 17, 2019. (Tr.  21,  62-
64; SOR response) He said he always timely  files his federal income tax returns. (Tr. 63)  
SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d allege Applicant is indebted to the federal government for 
delinquent taxes in the following amounts (rounded to the nearest $100): $3,800 for TY 
2019; $4,800 for TY 2021; and $2,400 for TY 2022, respectively. 
The following table contains information from IRS tax transcripts for adjusted gross 
income (AGI) for TYs 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022. (SOR response) Applicant did not 
provide IRS tax transcripts for TYs 2019, 2023, and 2024. He filed his federal income tax 
returns for TYs 2023 and 2024, and he said he owes about $300 for TY 2023 and $1,270 
for TY 2024. (Tr. 68 -69) The following table also shows his November 2024 IRS 
installment agreement, which indicates he owes $10,400 for TYs 2019, 2021, 2022, and 
2023. (Tr. 68-69; AE B): 
Tax Year Adjusted Gross Income 
Rounded to Nearest $1,000 
Account Balance Plus Accruals 
2018 $31,000 $0 
2019 $3,700 
2020 $62,000 $0 
2021 $76,000 $3,700 
2022 $47,000 $2,700 
2023 $300 
2024 $1,270 
Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts for TY 2018 show : he withheld $40 ; he paid $31 
when he filed his return; and he owed $1,581. (SOR response) From July 2019 to October 
2022, he made $31 monthly payments to the IRS. Id. On September 11, 2023, he paid

$790, and he resolved his tax debt for TY 2018. Id. In sum, he failed to pay his federal 
income taxes for TY 2019 until September 11, 2023. 
From April 2020 to October 2022, Applicant made monthly $31 payments to the 
IRS. (AE H ) His November 2, 2023 IRS installment agreement said he owed a total of 
$9,390 to the IRS consisting of $790 owed for TY 2018, $3,800 owed for TY 2019; and 
$4,800 owed for TY 2021. (AE A) He made the following payments to the IRS in 2023: 
September ($790); October ($500); and November ($500). (AE H) Generally, the IRS 
applies any payments received to the oldest tax debt. 
Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts for TY 2021 showed the following payments: 
October 6, 2023 ($275 and $225); October 24, 2023 ($500); November 20, 2023 ($500); 
and March 27, 2024 ($133). (SOR response ; AE H ) The two $500 payments made in 
2023 are noted in the preceding paragraph. He did not make any payments in January 
and February of 2024 because he was training for new employment, and he did not have 
any available income. (Tr. 65) 
Applicant’s November 20, 2024 IRS installment agreement shows he agreed to 
pay $141 monthly to the IRS. (AE B) Applicant made four $141 payments from December 
2024 to April 2025 to address his federal income tax debts for TYs 2019 and 2021. (Tr. 
65; AE A; AE H) He promised to continue the $141 monthly payments. (Tr. 30) He 
believes he could pay his federal income tax debt a year or two or sooner, if his security 
clearance is approved, and he receives the proffered employment. (Tr. 21, 66) Applicant 
said his employer does not withhold funds for federal income taxes. (Tr. 40, 66) However, 
he provided a pay stub showing his pay for seven days in December 2024 was $600 with 
$4 withheld from his pay for federal income taxes. (AE F) He could have a large tax bill 
for TY 2024 and possibly in TY 2025. (Tr. 67) He said he wants to pay his taxes; however, 
he did not pay his taxes because of insufficient income. (Tr. 67) 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant is indebted to a state for delinquent taxes in the 
approximate amount of $1,000 to $2,000 for TY 2022. He said he paid the debt in 2023, 
and he does not owe anything to the state tax authority. (Tr. 22, 60) He said a property 
tax refund was transferred to pay a state income tax debt. (Tr. 61) He said he would ask 
for proof of payment or current status from the state tax authority after his hearing. (Tr. 
61) 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant has an account that is past due for about $578 with a 
total loan balance of $9,994. Applicant had a vehicle lien for a 2013 vehicle. (SOR 
response) Applicant provided an August 3, 2024 statement from the creditor indicating 
the following payments: January 2024 ($280); February 2024 ($230); April 2024 ($275); 
and July 2024 ($300). Id. On July 13, 2024, the creditor wrote that monthly payment is 
$227, and $733 is due. Id. On April 21, 2025, the creditor wrote that the balance owed 
was $2,073. (Tr. 22; AE E) He said if he receives the employment he is seeking as a 
linguist, he will pay the remaining balance owed on this debt. (Tr. 22) His daughter is 
currently making payments on this debt. (Tr. 59)

Applicant is making payments to a debt consolidation company which is 
addressing four of his non-SOR debts. (AE J) I advised Applicant that it was crucial for 
him to provide more evidence of his tax situation after his hearing. I requested that he 
provide proof of his IRS payment plan and proof that the state tax debt is paid. (Tr. 77) 
He provided the requested federal income tax information; however, he did not provide 
proof that he paid his state tax debt. 
In October 2023, Applicant went on a vacation to Europe. (AE I) In 2024, Applicant 
and his spouse went on a Pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, and in May 2024, he went on a 
vacation to Europe. (AE I) 
Foreign Influence  
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant’s spouse owns a two-bedroom residence and three 
additional properties in Somalia with approximate values of $5,000, $5,000, $3,000, and 
$2,000 USD, respectively. Applicant said his spouse was unable to afford the payments, 
and she no longer owns the properties. (Tr. 23, 39, 57- 58) She sold one property to her 
sister. (Tr. 57) 
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges Applicant inherited property in Somalia with an approximate 
value of $35,000 USD. (Tr. 53) He learned that he received the property in 1994. (Tr. 53) 
In 2019, his sister purchased the property for $20,000, and Applicant used the money to 
pay down his mortgage on the house where he lives. (Tr. 38, 53; SOR response) 
Applicant said he sent an affidavit to enable his sister to transfer the property out of his 
name. (Tr. 24 ; AE G ) His sister is working on getting the property transferred in the 
records of Somalia. (Tr. 54) He and his spouse do not currently own any property in 
Somalia. (Tr. 24-25) 
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges Applicant’s brother and sister are citizens and residents of 
Somalia. SOR ¶ 2.d alleges Applicant’s brother is a citizen of Somalia and resident of 
Uganda. 
SOR ¶¶ 2.e through 2.g allege Applicant’s cousin, uncle, and aunt are citizens and 
residents of Somalia, respectively. Applicant said he ended contacts with his aunt, uncle, 
and cousin living in Somalia in 2023 when he was working in Somalia. (Tr. 25-26, 47-50) 
He does not intend to communicate with them in the future. (Tr. 47-50) 
SOR ¶ 2. h alleges Applicant’s mother’s cousin is a citizen of Somalia and a 
resident of Saudi Arabia. SOR ¶¶ 2.i and 2.j allege Applicant’s cousin and brother are 
citizens of Somalia and residents of the United Kingdom. SOR ¶ 2.k alleges his sister is 
a citizen of Somalia and a resident of the Netherlands. SOR ¶ 2.l alleges his stepmother 
is a citizen of Somalia and a resident of Ireland. Applicant admitted these four SOR 
allegations and clarified that his sister in SOR ¶ 2.k is a citizen of the Netherlands. 
In 1981, Applicant left Somalia and immigrated to the United States when he was 
16 years old. (Tr. 24, 31) He became a U.S. citizen in 1992. (Tr. 31) He has resided in

exercises good judgment. (Tr. 73) He recommended approval of Applicant’s security 
clearance. (Tr. 74) 
Somalia  
Somalia was established as a federal  parliamentary republic in 2012. Somalia has  
made strides towards  democracy and compliance with the rule of law since 2012. The 
U.S. State Department  has issued a “Level  4:  Do Not Travel Advisory for Somalia advising  
do not  travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, health issues,

kidnapping, and piracy . Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common 
throughout Somalia.” (HE 5 at 2 (emphasis in original)) Al -Shabaab, a terrorist 
organization, controls several areas in Somalia and has launched attacks into neighboring 
countries. Al-Shabaab has engaged in numerous bombings and murders targeting the 
Somali Government, civilians, and foreigners. Somali Government security forces in 
some instances have engaged in human rights violations. 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
7 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
     
    
  
  
   
    
  
 
 
 
    
 
   
    
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01 -20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
Analysis  
Foreign Influence  
AG ¶ 6 explains the security concern about “foreign contacts and interests” stating: 
Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, 
financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result 
in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they 
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced 
to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way 
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure 
or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts an d 
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest 
is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is 
known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or 
is associated with a risk of terrorism. 
AG ¶ 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying 
in this case: 
(a) contact, regardless of  m
 ethod, with a foreign family member,  business  
or professional associate, friend,  or other  person who is a citizen of or  
resident in a foreign country if that contact  creates  a heightened risk of  
foreign exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation, pressure,  or coercion;   
(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government,  or  country that  
create a potential conflict of interest  between the individual’s obligation to  
protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual’s  
desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that  
information or technology; and  
8 
 
 
 
  
      
     
   
  
  
   
  
 
  
  
    
   
 
    
 
  
 
 
   
   
 
  
    
   
  
    
    
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
    
    
  
 
  
 
(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country,  
or
 in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the  
individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or  
personal conflict of interest.  
The S
OR alleges, and Applicant admitted that he and his spouse owned property 
in Somalia. Applicant has siblings, aunt, uncle, and cousins who are citizens and 
residents of Somalia. He communicated with some of them until 2023. After 2023, he did 
not communicate with any residents of Somalia, and he does not intend to communicate 
with them in the future. His relationships with former Somalia citizens and residents who 
now live in Europe, Uganda, and the United States are not a security concern because 
they are not subject to criminals and terrorists in Somalia. 
Frequency of communications with relatives in a foreign country are not the sole 
determinant of a foreign influence disqualifying condition. The Appeal Board addressed 
a case where an applicant had connections with a former foreign Russian government 
official and a current Russian government official. ISCR Case No. 19 -02177 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Aug. 12, 2020). However, his communications with them were not recent and 
infrequent “about once every one to two years with the last time being in 2017” three 
years before his security clearance hearing. Id. The Appeal Board concluded these 
contacts were sufficient to raise a security concern and affirmed the denial of that 
applicant’s security clearance. Id. at 2-3. 
The mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is 
not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his or 
her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with 
even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the 
potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 08 -02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing 
problematic visits of that applicant’s father to Iran). 
Not every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG ¶ 7(a). The 
“heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family 
member living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the ties and t he 
country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its relationship with the United States, 
and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of 
vulnerability to coercion. “[T]he nature of the foreign government involved, and the 
intelligence-gathering history of that government are among the important considerations 
that provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the 
Judge’s ultimate conclusions in the case. The country’s human rights record is another 
important consideration.” ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another important consideration 
is the nature of a nation’s government’s relationship with the United States. These factors 
are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s family members or friends living 
in that country are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement.

The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign 
country has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including 
widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the 
government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a 
substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct 
intelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of So malia 
with the United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in that country 
places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his 
relationships with anyone living in or visiting Somalia does not pose a secur ity risk 
because of the risks due to terrorist activities in that country. Applicant should not be 
placed into a position where he might be forced to choose between the protection of 
classified information and concerns about assisting someone living in or visiting Somalia. 
The issue under Guideline B is whether Applicant has ties or contacts with relatives 
in Somalia, which raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a 
potential vulnerability that criminals, or terrorists could seek to exploit to get unauthorized 
access to U.S. classified information that he has by virtue of a security clearance. 
Applicant may be vulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, his relatives. 
International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as 
effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Somalia has a significant problem 
with terrorism and crime. Applicant’s relatives living in Somalia “could be a means through 
which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology 
and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.” ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). 
Applicant’s relationships with relatives who are living in Somalia or visiting Somalia  
create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on them to  
cause Applicant to compromise classified information. Those relationships create “a 
heightened risk of foreign inducement,  manipulation, pressure, or coercion” under  AG ¶  
7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant’s relationships with  
relatives in Somalia. AG ¶¶ 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) apply, and further inquiry i s necessary  
about potential application of any mitigating conditions.   
AG ¶ 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns 
including: 
(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign  per
 sons, the country in which  
these persons  are located, or the positions  or activities of those persons in  
that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a  
position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,  
group, organization,  or government  and the interests of the United States;  
(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of  
l
oyalty or obligation to the foreign per son, or allegiance to the gr oup,  
government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and  
longstanding relationships and l  oyalties in the United States, that the 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
  
 
 
   
 
   
 
  
   
     
   
individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the  
U.S. interest;  
(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent  
t
hat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or  
exploitation;  
(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or  
ar
e approved by  the agency  head or  designee;  
(e) the individual has  pr omptly complied with existing agency requirements  
regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats  from persons,  
groups, or organizations from  a foreign country; and  
(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property  
i
nterests is such that  they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could  not  be  
used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  
The 
Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
As indicated in the disqualifying conditions of the Foreign Influence section, supra, 
Applicant and his spouse had property in Somalia. They divested themselves of the 
property in Somalia. They have substantial property in the United States. AG ¶ 8(f) applies 
to their property in Somalia. 
Applicant has relationships with relatives living in Somalia. Terrorists and criminals 
could put pressure on Applicant by threatening his relatives in Somalia. Approval of a 
security clearance for Applicant increases the risk that they could be targeted to put 
pressure on Applicant to provide classified information. 
The Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or three months 
constitutes “frequent contact” under AG ¶¶ 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04 -09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) 
(finding contacts with applicant’s siblings once every four or five months not casual and 
11 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
   
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
    
  
 
  
 
   
     
      
       
   
        
  
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
   
   
 
 
    
  
  
 
 
  
 
infrequent and stating “The frequency with which Applicant speaks to his family members 
in Iran does not diminish the strength of his family ties.”). Frequency of contact is not the 
sole determinant of foreign interest security concerns. Applicant has not had any contacts 
with relatives in Somalia since 2023. 
A key factor in the AG ¶ 8(b) analysis is Applicant’s “deep and longstanding 
relationships and loyalties in the U.S.” His relationship with the United States must be 
weighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his connections to Somalia. 
Applicant was born in Somalia, and he moved to the United States in 1981 when he was 
16 years old. He became a U.S. citizen in 1992. He has a bachelor’s degree in electrical 
engineering. He has resided in the United States for 43 years. 
In 1996, Applicant’s spouse left Somalia, and she is a naturalized U.S. citizen. His 
seven children are citizens and residents of the United States. He has four grandchildren, 
and all of them are U.S. citizens. Two of Applicant’s brothers and two of his si sters are 
citizens and residents of the United States. He owns his home, and he has equity of about 
$375,000. 
These factors are balanced against the security concerns outlined in the SOR. 
Applicant’s access to classified information could add risk to his relatives in Somalia. 
There is no allegation that he would choose to help the terrorists against the interests of 
the United States. A Guideline B adjudication is not a judgment on an applicant’s 
character or loyalty to the United States. It is a determination as to whether an applicant’s 
circumstances foreseeably present a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 19- 00831 at 5 
(App. Bd. July 29, 2020). The concern here pertains to the risk to his relatives living in 
Somalia and how that risk could be used to coerce Applicant. It does not relate to his 
loyalty or patriotism to the United States. 
Applicant’s connections to the United States, taken together, are sufficient to 
overcome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. 
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.

The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
AG ¶ 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: 
(a) inability to satisfy  debts
 ;    
(c) a history of not  meet ing financial  obligations; and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax r
eturns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income tax as  
required.  
The recor
d establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. The 
financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 which may be applicable in 
this case are as follows: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  s
 o infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that  r esulted in the financial  problem were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
       
   
     
    
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai
 th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;     
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue;   
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income;  and  
(
g) the individual has  made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
AG ¶ 20(a) does  not apply to the SOR debts. “It is also well established that  an  
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts  demonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can  
be viewed as recent for purposes of  the Guideline F  mitigating conditions.” ISCR 22-
02226 at  2 (App.  Bd.  Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No.  15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.  
16, 2017)).  
A
pplicant’s income has been insufficient to take care of his family and pay his 
debts. He was unemployed for about eight months in 2023 after he returned to the United 
States from Somalia. He provided his AGI for three years as follows: $62,000 (2020); 
$76,000 (2021); and $47,000 (2022). He did not provide his AGI or an income statement 
for TYs 2023, 2024, and 2025. He did not provide enough recent information to establish 
he had insufficient income, and that he was unable to have made greater progress on his 
tax debts. Applicant’s illness and his unemployment are circumstances largely beyond 
his control, which adversely affected his finances. However, “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] 
financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or 
her] control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the applicant] has 
since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR 
Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007). The DOHA Appeal Board has said: 
[A]n applicant  must act responsibly given his or her circumstances and  
develop a reasonable plan for repayment,  accompanied by concomitant  
conduct even if it may  only provide for the payment of  debts one at  a time.  
ISCR Case No. 07 -06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21 , 2008). What  constitutes  
responsible behavior  depends on the facts  of  a given case and the fact that  
an applicant’s debts will not  be paid off  for a long time, in and of itself, may  
be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. 09- 08462 at 4. Relevant  to  
the equation is an assessment  as to whether  an applicant acted responsibly  
given [his  or]  her limited resources  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at  3-
4 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  
ADP Case No. 23- 00547 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2024). A component is whether he 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. Applicant did not give enough information about his income and taxes to

fully establish mitigation. He did not meet his burden of proof that he acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. 
“[A] single debt can be sufficient to raise Guideline F security concerns.” ISCR 
Case No. 19- 02667 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 14- 05366 at 3 
(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2016)). “Additionally, a single debt that remains unpaid over a period of 
years can properly be characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Id. 
Applicant has had delinquent federal income taxes since 2019. 
Applicant’s November 2, 2023 IRS statement said he owed a total of $9,390 to the 
IRS consisting of $790 owed for TY 2018; $3,800 owed for TY 2019; and $4,800 owed 
for TY 2021. His November 2024 IRS installment agreement shows he owed a total of 
$10,400 for TYs 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023. This does not include his delinquent tax 
debt for TY 2024 of $1,270. He is currently making $141 monthly payments to the IRS; 
however, his federal income tax debt increased more than $2,000 from November 2023 
to November 2024. The increase in tax debt shows he was not withholding enough from 
his pay or making quarterly tax payments to gradually cause his federal income tax debt 
to decrease. 
Applicant is credited with mitigation of the SOR allegations in 1.a and 1.f. He timely 
filed his federal income tax return for TY 2018. He has made payments to and significantly 
reduced the balance of his vehicle loan debt. 
Applicant’s IRS debt of $1,270 for TY 2024 was not alleged in the SOR. This debt 
will not be considered for disqualification purposes; however, it will be considered: “(a) in 
assessing [his] credibility; (b) in evaluating [his] evidence of extenuation, mit igation, or 
changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether [he] has demonstrated successful 
rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole- person concept.” ISCR Case No. 20 -02787 
at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022) (citing ISCR Case No. 15- 07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 
2017)). 
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance and noted: 
The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in 
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who 
begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that 
his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self -discipline to 
follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat 
to his own interests. In this case, [taking financial actions] after submitting 
his SCA, undergoing his background interview, or receiving the SOR 
undercuts the weight such remedial action might otherwise merit. 
In this instance, the SOR was issued on July 22, 2024. Applicant made four $141 
payments from December 2024 to April 2025 to address his federal income tax debt. 
Earlier, he was paying $31 monthly, and his federal income tax debt was increasing. It is 
15 
 
 
 
  
 
    
  
   
  
     
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
      
    
      
    
 
       
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
       
 
    
 
 
unclear whether the issuance of the SOR triggered the increase in tax payments to the 
IRS to $141. 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has 
purportedly corrected his or her financial problem, and the fact that applicant is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of applicant’s security worthiness considering his longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility. See ISCR Case No. 15- 01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an applicant’s course of conduct and 
employing an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of 
access to classified information). 
In this regard, the Appeal Board has previously stated that it is reasonable for a 
Judge to expect an applicant to present documentation corroborating actions taken to 
resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 19-03757 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2021) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020)). Applicant did not provide documentation 
showing payment of his state tax debt or progress reducing the overall magnitude of his 
federal income tax debt. He did not prove the trend of his IRS tax debt was a decreasing 
total tax debt. 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Since 2018, he has owed federal 
income taxes. He has not shown a meaningful track record of reducing his federal income 
tax debt. He did not prove his state tax debt is resolved. Financial considerations security 
concerns are not mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines B and 
F are incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment.

Applicant is a 59- year-old linguist, and he is seeking employment with a U.S. 
Government contractor. He worked for the U.S. Government as a linguist from 1993 to 
1994, and in 2023, and he held a security clearance or interim security clearance during 
those years. He currently is a self-employed or independent contractor-driver for a large 
company. In 1981, Applicant left Somalia and immigrated to the United States when he 
was 16 years old, and he became a U.S. citizen in 1992. He has a bachelor’s degree in 
electrical engineering. He has worked as a translator or interpreter for 15 years. In 2023, 
he was working for the U.S. Government in Somalia, and he had to return to the United 
States because of an illness. 
In 2022, Applicant received a certificate of appreciation for his patriotism from a 
private organization. He received a certificate of appreciation for his support to Operation 
Restore Hope in Somalia in 1993. A character witness who has known Applicant for seven 
years described him as loving, kind, patriotic, honorable, honest, reliable, and trustworthy. 
He said Applicant exercises good judgment. He recommended approval of Applicant’s 
security clearance. 
Somalia is a dangerous place because of violence from terrorists and criminals. 
Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the United States, and those who 
cooperate and assist the United States. Applicant has important connections to the United 
States as discussed under Guideline B. He has made a strong commitment to his future 
in the United States. His connections to the United States are sufficient to mitigate 
Guideline B security concerns. 
Applicant did not provide documentation showing payment of his state income 
taxes. He has a payment plan on his federal income tax debt; however, he did not show 
that he was withholding enough from his income to pay his federal income taxes when 
due. He did not prove he is reducing his federal income tax debt. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards documented resolution of his debts and maintenance of his 
financial responsibility, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. 
See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan , 
Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the 
facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated foreign 
influence security concerns; however, he failed to mitigate financial consider ations 
security concerns.
