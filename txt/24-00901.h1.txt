Decision 
GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns . Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted. 
Statement  of the Case  
On July 24, 2024, the Department of Defense (DOD ) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ) 
implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. 
Applicant submitted a response to the SOR on August 10, 2024 (Answer) and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
January 13, 2025. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
on January 22, 2025 , scheduling the matter for a hearing on February 18, 2025. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled.

At the hearing, I admitted in evidence without objection Government Exhibits (GE) 
1 through 7 and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Applicant testified and did not call any 
witnesses. At Applicant’s request, I kept the record open until March 4, 2025, to enable 
her to submit additional document ation. She timely submitted documentation that I 
marked collectively as AE B and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received 
the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 28, 2025. 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer. She is 44 years old, she 
has never married, and she has a 15-year-old child. She graduated from high school in 
1999, and she earned a bachelor’s degree in 2004, and a master’s degree in 2007. She 
previously owned a home from 2011 to December 2024. As of the date of the hearing, 
she has rented her current residence since February 2025. (Tr. 7, 28-29, 39, 48, 81-83, 
106-109; GE 1) 
Applicant worked for another U.S. Government agency , and held eligibility for a 
public trust position, from January 2009 until her voluntary departure in July 2022 . She 
then worked for a DOD contractor until July 2023, when she was terminated for failure to 
meet production standards. As of the date of the hearing, she has been unemployed since 
July 2023. She received an offer of employment as a background investigator from a DOD 
contractor in September 2023, contingent on obtaining a security clearance. She was 
granted eligibility for a public trust position in 2009 but has never held a clearance. (Tr. 5, 
7-9, 17-18, 29-35, 94; GE 1, 7; AE A) 
Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2018, and her bankruptcy was 
discharged in October 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.a) She also had 17 delinquent consumer debts, 
totaling $32,011. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.r) Her bankruptcy and delinquent debts are established 
by h er admissions in her Answer, her September 2023 security clearance application 
(SCA), her December 2023 background interview, court records, bankruptcy records, and 
credit bureau reports (CBRs) from September 2023, March 2024, and July 2024. (Tr.; GE 
1-7) 
Applicant disclosed her 2018 Chapter 7 bankruptcy on her SCA, and listed debts 
in the bankruptcy totaling $150,000. Her liabilities consisted primarily of credit card debt. 
She attributed her bankruptcy to becoming a single- income household in 2016 after her 
child’s father moved out of the home they purchased together in 2011. When they lived 
together, she was primarily responsible for their joint expenses but they split the mortgage 
and other bills. When he moved out, his financial contribution decreased to approximately 
$300 biweekly. She refinanced her home in 2016 to remove him from the loan. Before 
petitioning for bankruptcy, she tried to resolve her debts through a debt relief 
consolidation company (COMPANY). (Tr. 35-41, 48, 81-82, 96-97, 100, 109-113; GE 1, 
3, 7; AE A) She testified, “I first was going to do the debt relief but decided not to and 
decided to wipe my slate clean and start over to refresh myself to go on a new path.” (Tr. 
39)

Applicant attributes her financial issues  after her bankruptcy  to  her period of  
unemployment  since July 2023. She  received  unemployment benefits  from July  2023 to  
December 2023. She  also relied on the financial support provided by her  mother and  
grandmother.  She  has  attempted to secure other  employment opportunities pending t he  
outcome of her  security clearance, but her efforts  have been unsuccessful.  Since 2021,  
she has received $692 biweekly in court-ordered child support from  her child’s father, with  
whom she shares  custody,  but  she is primarily responsible for their  child, to include  the  
child’s  education-related  expenses. (Tr.  17-18, 30-32, 35-37, 41-42, 56, 76-82, 87-88, 94-
111; GE 2; AE A-B)   
In June 2024,  bank-initiated foreclosure proceedings  began for Applicant’s home.  
She was  13 months behind on her monthly mortgage payments of  $1,900.  Since she had 
equity in her home,  the bank  permitted her  to  sell her home in lieu of  foreclosure  and use  
the proceeds to pay  her  delinquent mortgage.  Having previously worked with COMPANY  
in 2018, s he  contacted COMPANY a gain  in July 2024 to try  to resolve her  debts. She 
made biweekly payments of  approximately  $179  to $217  to COMPANY,  who used the  
money to initiate  a settlement and make two payments  toward SOR  ¶ 1. c, as further  
discussed below. In December 2024  and January 2025, Applicant  sold her home  at  a 
profit of approximately $140,000,  she  paid her delinquent  mortgage,  and  the foreclosure  
proceedings were dismissed.  Upon selling  her home, s he stopped working with  
COMPANY in January 2025 and  instead used  the profit from the sale of her home t o 
resolve all her  debts.  She also repaid her  mother and grandmother  $30,000. As  of the  
date of the hearing, she had $70,000 remaining, which she intends  to use to pr ovide for  
her and her child  until  she regains employment. (Tr. 47-52, 72-76, 87-89, 94-111, 114-
116; GE 2; AE A-B)  
SOR ¶ 1.b is a $7,699 charged-off debt consolidation loan that Applicant obtained 
in July 2020 to try to resolve her credit cards. She made monthly payments of 
approximately $361 toward the loan from November 2021 until November 2023, when 
she could no longer afford to do so. She notified the bank of her inability to pay the loan 
but the bank told her it could not do anything for her since she was so far behind on her 
payments. (Tr. 42-46) In January 2025, s he settled the debt for approximately $6,300 
“when my money hit from my house.” (Tr. 45) She made two monthly payments of $525 
in January and February 2025, and she expects to continue making such monthly 
payments until this debt is resolved in January 2026. (Tr. 42-46, 79; AE A-B) 
SOR ¶ 1. c  is  a $5,551 charged- off  credit card.  Applicant believed this  account  
became delinquent in  2024. She di d not  contact the c reditor  because she did no t have  
the financial means to enter  a repayment plan.  COMPANY settled this  debt  on her  behalf  
for $4,000  and made  two payments of  $255 toward the settlement . She  then paid the 
remaining $3,600  in J anuary 2025  using the  proceeds  from  the  sale of her  home.  (Tr. 46-
47, 49-52; AE A)  
SOR ¶ 1.d is a credit account placed for collection for $2,254. When Applicant was 
working with COMPANY, this debt was included in her debt consolidation plan. In January 
2025, she settled this debt for $1,578 and paid it using the proceeds from the sale of her 
home. (Tr. 52-55; AE A)

SOR ¶ 1.e is a $1,438 charged- off store retail credit card. When Applicant was 
working with COMPANY, this debt was included in her debt consolidation plan. In 
February 2025, she paid t his debt in full using the proceeds from the sale of her home. 
(Tr. 55-56; AE A) 
SOR ¶¶  1.f-1.j are five  charged-off  debts with the same creditor , for  $514, $141,  
$136, $126, and $ 114, respectively.  SOR ¶  1.f is  a credit account  through w hich Applicant  
financed her  stationary bike, and s he  could not  recall  the accounts  underlying  SOR ¶¶  
1.g-1.j. She testified she made small  monthly  payments toward SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.j  before she  
began working with COMPANY.  She  made a final payment of  $308 and  resolved  SOR  ¶  
1.f in  January 2025.  She testified she  settled  SOR ¶  1.g for $84  in July  2024. She  made 
a final  payment  of $19  and resolved this debt in November 2024.  She testified she  settled 
SOR ¶  1.h for  $81  in July 2024. She made a final payment of  $19  and resolved this debt  
in September 2024. She settled SOR  ¶  1.i for $88, which she paid in three payments  of  
$29 from September through  November 2024. She made a final  payment of $22 i n August  
2024 to resolve SOR  ¶  1.j.  (Tr. 56-60, 94-96; AE A-B)  
SOR ¶ 1.k is a $1,586 charged- off credit card. When Applicant was working with 
COMPANY, this debt was included in her debt consolidation plan. She believed she made 
small payments toward this debt before January 2025, when she made a final payment 
of $1,428, using the proceeds from the sale of her home, to resolve this debt. (Tr. 60-61; 
AE A) 
SOR ¶ 1.l is a $743 charged- off retail store credit card. When Applicant was 
working with COMPANY, this debt was included in her debt consolidation plan. Using the 
proceeds from the sale of her home, she made a payment of $669 in January 2025 to 
resolve this debt. (Tr. 61-62; AE A) 
SOR ¶ 1.m is a $1,780 charged- off retail store credit card. When Applicant was 
working with COMPANY, this debt was included in her debt consolidation plan. Using the 
proceeds from the sale of her home, she made a payment of $890 in January 2025 to 
resolve this debt. (Tr. 62-63; AE A) 
SOR ¶ 1.n is a $4,142 charged -off credit union credit card. Applicant settled this 
debt for $3,150, which she paid in January 2025 using the proceeds from the sale of her 
home. (Tr. 63-64; AE A) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.o-1.q ar e three credit card debts  with the same creditor ,  past  due for  
$1,004, $1,409, and $1,692, respectively.  When Applicant was working with COMPANY,  
all three debts were included in her debt consolidation plan.  She settled and  paid all three  
debts  in January 2025, using the proceeds  from the sale of her  home, as follows:  SOR ¶ 
1.o for $652, SOR ¶ 1.p for $916, and SOR  ¶ 1.q for  $1,100. (Tr. 64-67; AE A)  
SOR ¶  1.r is  another  debt consolidation loan Applicant obtained,  to  try to resolve  
her  credit cards  and her car payment, past due for $1,682, with a total balance of $15,655.

testified she made consistent, monthly payments beginning in September 2024 . 
Documentation reflects six monthly payments of between $253 and $256 from October 
2024 to February 2025, with her balance as of that date reflected as $12,938, and that 
this account is no longer past due. (Tr. 67-70, 79, 84-85; AE A-B) 
Applicant expected to earn an annual salary of approximately $55,000 with her 
prospective employer. (Tr. 29-30) She earned approximately $45,000 annually from July 
2022 to July 2023 and $122,000 annually from January 2009 to July 2022. (Tr. 32 -33) 
She owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $25,000 in past-due federal 
taxes for tax years 2021 and 2022, related to her withdrawal from her 401(k) -retirement 
savings account during the COVID -19 pandemic. She testified she entered an initial 
installment plan with the IRS in approximately 2023 or 2024 of $300 monthly that she was 
unable to maintain. (Tr. 89-94, 105-106; AE B) 
Applicant stated she entered another installment plan with the IRS in December 
2024, consisting of monthly payments of $75 for 2025, set to increase to monthly 
payments of $400 in 2026 until her outstanding taxes are paid. She provided 
documentation reflecting she made two monthly payments of $75 in January and 
February 2025, she has such monthly payments scheduled from March 2025 to 
November 2025, and she is current on her monthly installment plan. She stated she does 
not have any outstanding state taxes. She intends to make larger payments to her 
outstanding federal taxes once she obtains employment and is more financially stable by 
using some of the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of her home. Applicant’s 
outstanding federal taxes were not alleged in the SOR and cannot be used for 
disqualification purposes but may be used while assessing the applicability of mitigating 
conditions and in my whole-person analysis. (Tr. 89-94, 105-106; AE B) 
Applicant  settled and paid another credit-card account  that was  not  alleged in the  
SOR, for  $890 in January 2025,  and she stated she does  not  have  any other  delinquent  
debts. (Tr. 70-72, 110-113; AE A) She keeps  a budget to track her  expenses, to include  
her child’s  private school tuition and her monthly rent of  $3,000. (Tr. 80-89, 101-113, 116-
117)  She received financial counseling in July 2018 during her bankruptcy proceedings  
and she completed a financial literacy course in February 2025.(Tr. 101; GE 3;  AE B) She 
did not have any  unfavorable issues during the period in  which she held  eligibility for a  
public trust position. (Tr. 35)    
Policies  
When evaluating an applicant ’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
5 
 
 
 
    
  
      
      
   
    
    
 
       
     
  
    
     
 
    
   
   
  
    
     
    
       
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
       
 
   
   
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
    
 
  
   
  
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national 
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of “compromise of classified information. Section 7 of E xec. Or. 
10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall 
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also 
Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or 
sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F:  Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambl ing, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
     
      
  
 
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
       
     
     
      
    
  
     
      
       
  
   
    
  
(a) inability to satisfy  debt s;  and  
(c) a history of not  mee ting financial  obligations.   
Appli
cant has a history of not being able to pay her debts, as evidenced by her 
2018 bankruptcy and her delinquent debts post -bankruptcy. AG ¶¶ 19 (a) and 19(c) are 
established. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,  wa s so infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  probl em were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or  separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem  from a  legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
(g) the individual has  mad e arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
Condit
ions beyond Applicant’s control contributed to her 2018 bankruptcy and her 
delinquent debts post -bankruptcy. The first prong of AG ¶ 20(b) applies. For the full 
application of AG ¶ 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under 
her circumstances. She made some payments toward some of her debts, to include SOR 
¶ 1.b and SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.j, before the SOR. She contacted the same debt consolidation 
company, with whom she had previously worked in 2018 , in July 2024 to try to resolve 
her debts. In December 2024 and January 2025, she sold her home and used half of the 
$140,000 profit to pay her delinquent mortgage and most of her delinquent debts. She 
resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.q, and she has made payments in accordance with payment plans 
for SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.r. Although she owes approximately $25,000 in federal taxes, she 
has made monthly payments of $75 in accordance with an installment agreement she 
has in place with the IRS, for which she is current. She intends to continue to resolve 
these remaining debts. She has received financial counseling and she understands the 
importance of maintaining her finances under control considering her financial history . I

find that these financial issues do not continue to cast doubt on h er reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) apply. 
Whole-Person Concept 
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which  participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for  pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-
person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts 
about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1,  G
 uideline F:   FOR  APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.r:  For  Applicant     
Conclusion  
In l
ight of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
