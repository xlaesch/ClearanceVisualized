Decision 
HEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant’s handling of his state and federal income taxes resulted in unmitigated 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
History of the Case  
On July 11, 2024 , the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
alleging security concerns under Guideline F. (Item 1) The CAS acted under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 
2017. 
Applicant answered the SOR on August 3, 2024, and requested a decision based 
upon the administrative record (Answer). (Item 3) A copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM), dated September 3, 2024, was provided to Applicant by letter on September 4, 
2024. Department Counsel attached as evidence to the FORM Items 1 through 5. 
Applicant received the FORM on September 9, 2024, and he was afforded a period of 30

days to  file objections  and  submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He  
responded  twice  to the FORM  in a timely manner.  On  November 12,  2024, the  case was  
assigned  to  me.  I marked  the  documents  provided  by Applicant in  his FORM  responses  
as Applicant Exhibits  (AE)  A (pages 1-35) and  AE  B  (pages 1-32).  Department Counsel  
did not object to  these  documents,  nor did  Applicant  object to  any of the  Government’s  
documentation  in  his response  to  the  FORM. Both  parties’ documentation  is admitted  into  
evidence.  
Findings of Fact  
Applicant, 31, lives with  his parents, has never been  married, and  has a  six-year-
old son. He received  a  high  school diploma  in 2010  and  completed  a  30-week welding  
program  in  2014. He has worked  as a  welder  for his  current  employer since  September  
2022. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item  3; Item  5)  
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file, in a timely manner, his federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2018 through 2022, and, as of the date of the SOR, 
they remained unfiled. In his Answer, he admitted both SOR allegations and indicated, “I 
have since provided documentation to show they are being filed .” This documentation is 
discussed at length below. (Item 1; Item 2) 
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in March 2023, and in 
response to questions regarding his tax history dating back seven years, he admitted to 
failing to file his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2018 through 2021. For both 
his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2018, 2019, and 2020, he indicated he 
“[j]us(t) failed to file” but was currently working on resolving his unfiled returns. He 
estimated he owed between $600 to $800 for each of th ose tax years. For TY 2021, he 
was unable to file his federal and state income tax returns because he did not receive his 
tax documents from his employer. He estimated he owed $1,800 for TY 2021 and planned 
“to take care of it.” (Item 3) 
In May 2023, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, and his 
unfiled federal and state income tax returns were discussed. He admitted his income tax 
returns for TY 2018 through 2021 remained unfiled and further disclosed his federal and 
state income tax returns for TY 2022 were also unfiled. In explanation of these issues, he 
state that, prior to 2018, he used an individual to file his returns for him; however, the 
individual stopped preparing taxes at an unstated date, and he did not find or hire a new 
individual or company to file his returns. He stated he intended to gather his tax paperwork 
and hire help to file his returns by the fall of 2023. Starting in 2020, he was court-ordered 
to pay $758 bi-weekly support for his son, and he failed to resolve his tax issues due to 
uncertainty as to how much it would cost and the demand of his child support obligation. 
(Item 5) 
Applicant responded to CAS interrogatories in December 2024. In response to the 
request to provide federal and state tax account statements , he submitted tax account 
statements from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for only TY 2019 and 2021. Both 
statements reflect he had not filed income tax returns as of January 5, 2024. Additionally,

in his response to the interrogatories, he provided a budget, which showed a negative net 
monthly remainder of $1,129. (Item 4) 
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR , he provided copies of his federal income tax 
returns for TY 2019 through 2022, and his state income tax returns for TY 2018, 2019, 
2020, and 2022. None of the return copies were dated nor signed. Cover letter s 
accompanying each TY’s returns reflected Applicant’s signature and hand-written dates 
of July 28, 2024, for TY 2019 through 2022, and August 7, 2024, for TY 2018. Applicant 
claimed the following regarding his federal income tax obligations as of August 2024: TY 
2018 (refund $2,241); TY 2019 (owes $1,397 + unknown amount of interest ); TY 2020 
(refund of $3,680); TY 2022 (refund of $2). He claimed the following regarding his state 
income tax obligations as of August 2024: TY 2018 (refund $318); TY 2019 (refund $136); 
TY 2020 (refund of $162); TY 2022 (refund of $286). He did not address his federal and 
state tax obligations for TY 2021. (Item 2) 
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he provided updated copies of his federal 
income tax returns for TY 2019 through 2022, and his state income tax returns for TY 
2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022. Each return copy reflected his signature and a date of 
September 11, 2024. He did not include documentation demonstrating the IRS and his 
state tax authority either received or accepted the returns. He did not provide proof of 
payments or a payment plan for his admitted TY 2019 federal income taxes. (AE A) 
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties, in part, to his various arrests. Neither 
his arrests nor his admitted TY 2019 federal taxes were alleged in the SOR. The record 
reflected numerous other unalleged delinquent debts. These unalleged delinquent taxes 
and other debts and arrests will not be considered as disqualifying conduct, but they may 
be considered in determining whole -person analysis and applicability of mitigating 
conditions. Applicant provided documentation to demonstrate he resolved or was making 
payments toward several of the unalleged non-tax debts. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; AE B) 
Policies  
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG ), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance , the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
3 
 
 
 
     
       
         
 
 
      
    
    
 
 
           
        
    
              
      
       
           
  
 
          
           
      
  
 
 
 
  
 
     
   
            
    
      
          
      
     
    
   
 
      
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number o f variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government  must present evidence  to  establish  
controverted  facts alleged  in the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15, the  applicant  is  
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or  
mitigate  facts admitted  by the  applicant or proven  by Department Counsel.” The  applicant  
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion  to  obtain  a favorable  security  decision.   
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F: Financial Considerations  
The concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
4 
 
 
 
       
     
         
 
 
       
     
 
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           
               
         
       
         
      
 
 
       
      
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
The record evidence of Applicant’s failure to file his income tax returns in a timely 
manner establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
(f)  failure to  file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local income  
tax returns or failure to  pay annual Federal,  state, or local income  tax as  
required.  
AG ¶ 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following 
are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a)  the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that  it is  unlikely to  recur and  does not  cast doubt  
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   
(b)  the  conditions  that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely  beyond  
the  person's control  (e.g.,  loss of  employment,  a  business downturn,  
unexpected  medical emergency,  a  death,  divorce  or separation, clear  
victimization  by predatory lending  practices, or identity  theft), and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has received  or is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  form  a  legitimate  and  credible, source such  as a  non-profit credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is being  
resolved  or is under control;  
(d) the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and   
(g) the  individual  has  made  arrangements  with  the  appropriate  tax  authority  
to  file  or pay  the  amount  owed  and  is in compliance  with  those  
arrangements.  
Applicant disclosed his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns for 
TY 2018 through 2021 in his March 2023 SCA. For TY 2018 to 2020, he admitted he, 
“[j]us(t) failed to file.” He explained his employer did not provide him with his tax 
documentation for TY 2021 . During his May 2023 interview with a government 
investigator, he indicated he also failed to file his federal and state tax returns for TY 
2022. Additionally, in 2020, he was ordered to pay child support for his son, who was born 
in 2018. 
Overall, Applicant failed to demonstrate he acted reasonably under these 
circumstances to address his unfiled tax returns. He was aware his unfiled tax returns 
5 
 
 
 
            
          
     
       
       
           
            
 
 
      
 
     
     
      
       
           
      
         
        
      
      
        
         
         
  
 
 
          
         
 
were a security concern as of March 2023, when he completed his SCA . The concern 
was highlighted during his subject interview in May 2023, and when he received the CAS 
interrogatories in December 2024. However, he did not attempt to file, hire a tax 
professional, or otherwise resolve his unfiled tax returns until after the SOR was issued 
in July 2024. Additionally, the documentation he provided in his Answer and in his 
response to the FORM did not sufficiently establish the date he filed his tax returns with 
the IRS and his state tax agency , or the date either entity received and accepted the 
returns. 
Regarding the failure to file tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14 -01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
ISCR  Case  No. 14-04437  at  3  (App.  Bd. Apr. 15, 2016)  (emphasis  in original). See  also  
ISCR  Case  No.  15-01031  at 4  (App. Bd. June  15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR  Case  
No.  14-05476  at  5  (App. Bd.  Mar. 25,  2016) (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  01-05340  at  3  (App.  
Bd.  Dec.  20, 2002)); ISCR  Case  No.  14-01894  at  4-5  (App.  Bd. Aug.  18,  2015).  The  
Appeal Board clarified  that even  in  instances where an  “[a]pplicant has purportedly   
corrected  [his or her] federal tax problem, and  the  fact that [applicant]  is now motivated  
to  prevent  such  problems  in the  future,  does not preclude  careful consideration  of  
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of   [his or her] longstanding  prior behavior   
evidencing  irresponsibility” including  a  failure  to  timely file federal  income  tax returns.  See  
ISCR  Case  No. 15-01031  at 3  &  n.3  (App. Bd. Jun.  15, 2016) (characterizing  “no  harm,  
no  foul”  approach  to  an  applicant’s  course  of  conduct  and  employing  an  “all’s well that 
ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information  
with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG ¶ 20(g) applied, and noted: 
The  timing  of  the  resolution  of  financial problems is  an  important factor in  
evaluating  an  applicant’s case  for mitigation  because  an  applicant who   
begins to  resolve financial problems only after being  placed  on  notice  that  
his clearance  was in jeopardy may lack the  judgment and  self-discipline  to  
6 
 
 
 
 
         
    
      
         
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
       
          
    
        
    
 
 
    
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
follow rules and regulations over time  or when there is no immediate threat  
to  his own interests. In  this case, applicant’s filing  of his Federal income  tax  
returns for 2009-2014  after submitting  his SCA, undergoing  his background  
interview, or receiving  the  SOR undercuts  the  weight such  remedial action  
might otherwise merit.  
In this case, Applicant has yet to demonstrate he filed his TY 2018 through 2022 
federal and state income tax returns. Because there is no documentary proof he filed his 
returns, it remains unclear how much he may owe for these tax years , including his 
admitted TY 2019 federal taxes of at least $ 1,397 for which he has yet to establish a 
payment plan. Mitigation under AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20( d), and 20(g) was not 
established. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative judge  must  evaluate  an  
applicant’s eligibility for a  security clearance  by considering  the  totality of the  applicant’s  
conduct and  all  relevant circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider the  
nine  adjudicative  process factors listed at AG  ¶ 2(d):  
(1) the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation;  (3) the  frequency  and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the   time  of the  conduct;  (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of rehabilitation  
and  other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the  motivation  for the  conduct;  
(8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  (9) the  
likelihood  of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole -person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant has not 
met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the financial considerations 
security concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. 
Formal Findings  
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:   AGAINST  APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs 1.a  –  1.b:   Against Applicant  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
        
   
 
 
 
 
 
__________________________ 
Conclusion 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of 
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
