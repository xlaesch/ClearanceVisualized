Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated . 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On April 10, 2023 , Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On August 6, 2024 , the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960 ); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992 ), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A , the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be g ranted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) 
1 
 
 
                                         
 
        
      
          
        
       
 
       
    
          
          
       
 
 
 
       
        
     
 
        
             
         
       
  
   
 
 
        
 
 
 
       
    
  
   
  
 
 
   
      
       
          
Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR. On October 21, 2024, Department 
Counsel was ready to proceed. On November 6, 2024, the case was assigned to me. 
On November 8, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice scheduling the hearing on December 16, 2024. (HE 1) The hearing was held as 
scheduled, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant did not offer any documents into evidence. (Tr. 11, 18-21; GE 1-GE 4) There 
were no objections, and a ll proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 20-21) 
On December 27, 2024, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. The record was not 
held open after the hearing. (Tr. 77) 
Some  details were  excluded  to  protect Applicant’s right to  privacy. Specific   
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted that he opened the accounts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, and he said his spouse opened the other SOR accounts under his name. 
He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
Applicant is a 42-year-old field technician, who has worked for a government 
contractor for nine years. (Tr. 6, 8) In 2001, he graduated from high school, and he has 
not attended college. (Tr. 6-7) In 2003, he married, and in 2018, he divorced. (Tr. 8, 22) 
His two children are ages 16 and 21. (Tr. 8) He is cohabiting with his fiancée who has 
two children who are ages 14 and 15. (Tr. 23) His monthly child -support obligation is 
$600. (Tr. 24) In May 2024, Applicant and his fiancée had a child. (Tr. 25) His fiancée is 
a bartender. (Tr. 26) She is paid $10 an hour plus tips. (Tr. 26) 
Applicant served in the Air Force for 13 years. (Tr. 9) His Air Force specialty was 
structural journeyman. (Tr. 8) He was honorably discharged from the Air Force as a staff 
sergeant (E-5). (Tr. 9) 
Financial Considerations   
Applicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) in which he indicated 
gross monthly salary of $2,970; net monthly salary of $1,915; total net monthly income 
of $3,829; total monthly expenses of $2,946; monthly debt payment of $177; and net 
monthly remainder of $706. (GE 2 at 10) He did not explain why his net monthly income 
was more than his gross monthly salary. 
At his hearing, Applicant said his annual salary is $63,447, which is substantially 
more than his gross monthly salary on his PFS of about $36,000. (Tr. 27) He said his 
monthly rent is $2,000 ; however, his PFS indicates rent of $700 . (Tr. 25) His fiancée 
currently pays half of the rent and some of the other bills. (Tr. 27) During Appellant’s 
marriage, his spouse handled the family finances. (Tr. 34) In his June 2023 Office of 
2 
 
 
                                         
 
      
  
 
       
      
  
 
        
           
         
        
     
        
    
             
      
        
     
          
   
 
    
         
  
              
 
 
      
         
     
       
           
 
 
       
         
      
         
             
     
        
    
 
         
          
        
Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant said he was 
unaware of some of his delinquent debts until his OPM PSI. (Tr. 35) 
Appellant’s August 6, 2024 SOR alleges and his June 6, 2023, and April 1, 2024 
credit bureau reports (CBR) state he has eight delinquent debts totaling $56,602. The 
status of the SOR debts is as follows: 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $34,674. In 2014, Applicant and his 
spouse borrowed the funds to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 39 , 56 ) He said his spouse 
received the vehicle and accepted responsibility for the debt during their divorce 
discussions; however, this allocation of responsibility was not included in their divorce 
decree. (Tr. 39-40, 57) The last payment was made in 2019. (Tr. 56) Applicant has not 
contacted the creditor or made any efforts to pay the debt. (Tr. 40-41) His former spouse 
advised him that she did not care about the debt. (Tr. 41) His June 6, 2023 CBR states, 
“Charged off as bad debt Profit and loss write -off.” (GE 2 at 42; GE 3 at 2) His April 1, 
2024 CBR includes this debt as a “PROFIT AND LOSS WRITEOFF.” (GE 4) He said the 
debt has been dropped from his credit report. (Tr. 41) He did not provide any credit 
reports. His former spouse has possession of the vehicle. (Tr. 41, 57) After he received 
the SOR, he decided not to contact the creditor to find out about the debt because he 
believed it was written off. (Tr. 58) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege two accounts placed for collection for $687 and $614. 
Applicant obtained the two credit cards after his divorce. (Tr. 47) He has been making 
monthly payments of $29 to the creditor since January 2024. (Tr. 41-43; GE 2 at 21-23) 
These two debts are mitigated because he has them in an established voluntary payment 
plan. 
SOR ¶ 1. d alleges a charged -off debt for $ 16,062. Applicant’s pay is being 
garnished $90 twice a month. (Tr. 44) He intends to continue the garnishment until the 
debt is paid. (Tr. 45) He was unaware the debt was delinquent during his marriage until 
he received the garnishment order in September of 2021. (Tr. 36, 46) At the time of the 
garnishment, the balance owed was $19,355. (GE 2 at 16) The debt is not listed on his 
April 1, 2024 CBR. (GE 4) 
SOR ¶ ¶ 1.e alleges an account placed for collection for $ 1,990; 1.f alleges a 
charged-off debt for $1,272; 1.g alleges a charged-off debt for $720; and 1.h alleges an 
account placed for collection for $551. Applicant said his spouse probably opened the 
accounts with his consent. (Tr. 49-53) He was unaware of the accounts being delinquent 
until he completed his 2023 SCA and 2023 OPM PSI. (Tr. 50-53) He asked his spouse 
to pay the debts; however, he did not hear anything about her doing anything about the 
debts. (Tr. 50-53) He indicated the debts may have been charged off or dropped from 
his credit reports. (Tr. 50-51) They are not listed on his April 1, 2024 CBR. (GE 4) 
Applicant has about $100 available at the end of the month to address delinquent 
debts. (Tr. 53) He does not have a savings account, and his checking account has a 
balance of about $100. (Tr. 54) He pays $40 or $50 a month into his retirement account,

and he estimated the balance is about $10,000. (Tr. 53 -54) He has not received any 
credit counseling. (Tr. 54) 
Character Evidence  
Applicant’s supervisor and friend, who has known Applicant for 10 years , and a 
coworker and friend, who has known Applicant for 20 years, described him as diligent, 
professional, reliable, honest, trustworthy, and responsible. (Tr. 62-73) Their statements 
support approval of his access to classified information. 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority 
to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether 
an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. 
The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information . 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant ’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
4 
 
 
                                         
 
        
       
           
          
          
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
     
   
        
    
    
            
     
     
         
  
 
        
       
  
 
    
       
       
     
    
       
     
      
   
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant ’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once  the  Government establishes a  disqualifying  condition  by substantial 
evidence, the  burden  shifts to  the  applicant to  rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate  the  
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the  ultimate burden of demonstrating  that it  
is clearly consistent with  the  national interest  to  grant or continue  his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR   Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd. Dec. 19,  2002). The  burden  of 
disproving  a  mitigating  condition  never shifts  to  the  Government.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  
02-31154  at 5  (App.  Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance  determinations should err,  
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant ’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant ’s self -control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets 
as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guideline s 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.

AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” 
“[A]  single  debt  can  be  sufficient  to  raise  Guideline  F security concerns.” ISCR   
Case  No.  19-02667  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Nov.  3,  2021) (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  14-05366  at 3  
(App.  Bd. Feb.  5,  2016)). “Additionally, a  single  debt  that  remains  unpaid  over  a  period  
of years can properly be characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Id.  
The record establishes the disqualifying condition s in AG ¶ ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). 
Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required . 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 , which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent,  or occurred  
under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur and  does not cast 
doubt on  the  individual’s current   reliability, trustworthiness,   or  good  
judgment;  
(b) the  conditions that resulted  in the  financial problem  were  largely beyond  
the  person’s control (e.g.,  loss of employment,  a  business downturn, 
unexpected  medical emergency, a  death, divorce  or separation, clear 
victimization  by  predatory lending  practices,  or identity  theft),  and  the  
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c)  the  individual has  received  or  is receiving  financial counseling  for the  
problem  from  a  legitimate  and  credible  source,  such  as  a  non-profit  credit  
counseling  service, and  there are clear indications that the  problem  is  
being resolved or is under control;  
(d) the  individual initiated  and  is adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort to  repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and  
(e) the  individual has a  reasonable basis to  dispute  the  legitimacy of the  
past-due  debt which  is the  cause  of the  problem  and  provides documented  
proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or provides  evidence  of 
actions to resolve the issue.  
The  Appeal Board in ISCR  Case  No.  10-04641  at 4  (App. Bd.  Sept.  24, 2013)  
explained  Applicant’s responsibility for  proving  the  applicability of  mitigating  conditions  
as follows:  
Once  a  concern arises regarding  an  Applicant’s security clearance   
eligibility,  there is a  strong  presumption  against  the  grant or maintenance  
6 
 
 
                                         
 
       
      
       
       
      
    
         
  
  
 
 
         
 
 
        
        
        
         
 
 
 
    
 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied , 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
AG ¶  20(a) does  not apply  to  the  SOR debts. “It is also  well established  that an  
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts demonstrate  a  continuing  course of conduct and  can  
be  viewed  as  recent for purposes   of  the  Guideline  F  mitigating  conditions.” ISCR  22-
02226  at  2  (App.  Bd. Oct.  27,  2023) (citing  ISCR  Case  No. 15-06532  at 3  (App.  Bd.  Feb. 
16, 2017)).  
Applicant  was divorced  in 2018. Divorce is a  circumstance  largely  beyond  his 
control, which  affected  his finances. Howe ver, “[e]ven  if [an  applicant’s]  financial  
difficulties initially arose, in  whole  or  in part,  due  to  circumstances outside  his  [or her]  
control, the  [administrative  judge]  could  still  consider whether [the  applicant]  has since  
acted  in a  reasonable manner when  dealing  with  those  financial difficulties.” ISCR  Case  
No.  05-11366  at 4  n.9  (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  03-13096  at 4  
(App. Bd.  Nov.  29, 2005); ISCR  Case  No. 99-0462  at 4  (App.  Bd.  May 25, 2000); ISCR  
Case  No.  99-0012  at 4  (App. Bd.  Dec.  1, 1999)). Applicant did not establish  that he  acted  
responsibly under the  circumstances  because  he  has not made  significant progress  
addressing  his delinquent SOR debts, and the  connections to  and  financial costs of his  
divorce  to  his  current delinquent debts  are  unclear.  
As indicated previously, SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c for $687 and $614 are mitigated 
because he has them in an established payment plan. 
Applicant was married from 2003 until 2018. He said his spouse was managing 
their accounts, and she opened some accounts without his specific permission to do so 
or he gave her verbal permission to open the accounts without ensuring the debts were 
paid. In a case where an applicant blamed his spouse for mishandling their finances, the 
Appeal Board said: 
The  degree  of ignorance  claimed  by Applicant suggests an  indifference  to  
the  proper satisfaction  of legal obligations  that  draws into  question  his  
willingness or  capacity to  comply  with  the  sometimes  complex  rules  
governing  the  handling  and  safeguarding  of classified  information. Reliance  
upon  a  spouse  or upon  some  other person  to  fulfill one’s legal obligations  
places responsibility on  an  applicant to  remain  aware  of the  extent to  which  
the spouse or other  person is acting reliably on his or her behalf.

SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a charged -off debt for $16,062. Applicant’s pay is being 
garnished $90 twice a month to address this debt. He said he was unaware the debt was 
delinquent during his marriage until he received the garnishment order in September of 
2021. The Appeal Board has addressed the mitigative effect of paying a debt through 
garnishment as follows: 
Court-ordered  or otherwise involuntary means of debt resolution, such  as  
garnishment,  are entitled  to  less  weight than  means initiated  and  carried  
through  by the  debtor  himself. See, e.g.,  ISCR  Case  No.  14-05803  at 3  
(App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016).  Indeed, reliance  upon  garnishment, refund  
interception, or bankruptcy do  not equate  to  good-faith  efforts by Applicant  
to  resolve his financial problems  . . . . The  Directive  does not define  the  term  
“good  faith.” However, we have  stated  that the  concept of good  faith  
“requires a  showing  that a  person  acts in a  way that shows reasonableness,  
prudence  honesty,  and  adherence  to  duty or obligation.” See, e.g., ISCR  
Case  No.  99-9020  at 5-6  (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). Accordingly, an  applicant  
must do  more  than  show that he  or she  relied  on  a  legally available options  
such  as garnishment and  bankruptcy in order to  receive the  full  benefit of  
Mitigating Condition  20(d).  
ISCR Case No. 17 -04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (reversing grant of security 
clearance). 
Applicant indicated  several of his SOR debts were  dropped  from  his credit report. 
“[T]hat some  debts have  dropped  off  his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence  
of debt  resolution.”  ISCR  Case  No.  14-05803  at  3  (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing  ISCR  
Case  No.  14-03612  at 3  (App. Bd.  Aug. 25, 2015)). The  Fair  Credit Reporting  Act  
requires removal of most negative  financial items  from  a  credit report seven  years from  
the  first date  of  delinquency  or the  debt  becoming  collection  barred  because  of a  state 
statute  of  limitations, whichever is longer.  See  Title  15  U.S.C. §  1681c. Debts may be  
dropped  from  a  credit report upon  dispute  when  creditors believe  the  debt is not going  
to  be  paid, a  creditor fails to  timely respond  to  a  credit  reporting  company’s request for  
information,  or when the debt has been charged off.  
“[U]ntil an applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as 
a matter of law that he has initiated a good -faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolved debts. The phrase ‘meaningful track record ’ necessarily includes 
evidence of actual debt reduction through payment on debts.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007)). 
Financial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated. Applicant’s 
SOR alleges he has eight delinquent debts totaling $56,602. He mitigated two SOR debts 
because he has them in a voluntary payment plan. He did not maintain contact with 
several of his creditors. He does not have a payment plan to address most of his 
delinquent debts, and he has not made any payments to five of the eight SOR creditors. 
I am not confident that he will establish payment plans, pay, or otherwise resolve these 
five debts, and maintain his financial responsibility.

Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole -person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the  nature, extent,  and  seriousness  of the  conduct;  (2) the  
circumstances surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the  frequency and  recency of the  conduct; (4) the  
individual’s age  and  maturity at the  time  of the  conduct; (5) the  extent to  
which  participation  is voluntary; (6) the  presence  or absence  of 
rehabilitation  and  other  permanent behavioral  changes;  (7) the  motivation  
for the  conduct; (8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or  
duress;  and (9) the likelihood  of continuation  or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. M y comments under 
Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is a 42 -year-old field technician, who has worked for a government 
contractor for nine years. In 2003, he married, and in 2018, he divorced. He served in 
the Air Force for 13 years. He was honorably discharged from the Air Force as a staff 
sergeant. A supervisor and friend, who has known Applicant for 10 years, and a coworker 
and friend , who has known App licant for 20 years , described him as diligent, 
professional, reliable, honest, trustworthy, and responsible. Their statements support 
approval of his access to classified information. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations analysis section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the 
evidence of mitigation. He did not establish that he was unable to make more timely and 
significant progress resolving his SOR debts. The financial evidence raises unmitigated 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 18. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot 
or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the 
future. With more effort towards resolution of his debts and maintenance of his financial 
responsibility, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of h is security 
clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances 
in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations 
security concerns.

_________________________ 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph  1.a:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d through 1.h:  Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
I conclude  that  it  is not  clearly consistent  with  the  interests  of national security of 
the  United  States to  grant  or continue  Applicant’s national  security  eligibility for  access  
to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information  is denied.
