Decision 
PRICE, Eric C., Administrative Judge: 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On  January 9, 2023, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA).  
On  August 6, 2024,  the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) issued  
to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline  
F. The action was taken under Department  of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6,  Defense 
Industrial Personnel  Security Clearance Review Program  (January 2,  1992),  as amended  
(Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent  
Directive 4 (SEAD 4),  National Security  Adjudicative Guidelines  (December  10, 2016), for 
all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8,  2017.  
Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on September 14, 2024, and requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 1, 2025. 
On June 13, 2025, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
of hearing scheduling the hearing via video teleconference. 
 
 
  
  
   
  
      
        
   
 
 
          
    
     
     
 
        
       
   
   
   
 
       
  
       
 
         
 
    
    
      
     
    
      
    
    
      
        
 
     
 
 
 
       
     
I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 21, 202 5. Department Counsel 
offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1 through GE 7, which were admitted without objection. 
(Transcript (Tr.) 14-25; Hearing Exhibit (HE) I-II) Applicant testified and offered Applicant 
Exhibit (AE) A and AE B, which were admitted without objection . (Tr. 26-27; HE III) At 
Applicant’s request I held the record open until September 12, 2025 , to permit her to 
submit additional documents but she did not do so. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
on August 1, 2025, and the record closed on September 12, 2025. (HE IV) 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant is 45 years old. She has worked as a program engineer for a federal 
contractor since December 2022. She was employed in various engineering positions in 
different divisions of the same company from September 2012 to December 2022. She 
has never held a security clearance. (GE 1 at 12-16; Tr. 33, 63-64) 
Applicant has been taking online university courses since 2009 but has not yet 
earned a degree. She was married from 1998 to 2006, and has three children from that 
marriage, ages 20, 22, and 26. She has been married to her current spouse since July 
2015 and has three stepchildren from her current spouse, including two adults and one 
under 18 years of age. (GE 1; GE 7; Tr. 28-30) 
The SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling about $29,028 including $11,920 in 
delinquent federal taxes, and failure to file federal and state income tax returns , as 
required, for tax year (TY) 2018. Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.d-1.f, 1.j, and 1.l, with explanations. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1. c, 1.g-1.i, 
and 1.k, with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. (Answer) 
Applicant attributes her financial problems to her spouse’s inability to work 
because of medical conditions and her spouse’s debt. She also attributes her financial 
problems to the cost of moving for a job that paid less than anticipated, underemployment, 
and to potential identity theft. She has focused on paying essential bills and expressed 
her intent to resolve her delinquent debts and to seek the assistance of a tax professional 
to resolve her tax issues as soon as she can afford to do so. At hearing, she testified that 
she contacted a financial counseling and debt repair service offered through her employer 
in about May 2025 but had not yet received financial counseling or enrolled her debt in 
the program. She started a side business to generate additional income to pay down her 
debt. (Answer; GE 1 at 38-41, GE 2 at 27-28, GE 7 at 1-5; Tr. 30-47, 62-63; AE A) 
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. 
SOR ¶  1.a:  telecommunications  account in collection for $ 1,613.  Applicant  
attributes this  debt t o a  provider’s failure to explain the process of replacing her spouse’s  
phone when it  stopped working resulting in unrequested and undesired account changes  
and charges  to her  and her spouse’s account.  (Answer)  
Credit reports from April 2024 and July 2025 show this account as in collection for 
$1,613 and $1,614, respectively. (GE 5 at 2, GE 6 at 3 ) Applicant testified she disputed 
2 
 
 
       
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the debt but that the service provider did not want to resolve it. She hopes to resolve the 
debt through a program offered by her employer. (Tr. 40-43) This debt is unresolved. 
SOR ¶ ¶ 1.b  and 1.i : medical collection account s for $ 693  and $111,  
respectively.  Applicant  admitted SOR  ¶  1.b and denied SOR ¶  1.i  noting she had been  
unable to track down the source  for this debt. (Answer)  She  testified that she believed  
these debts  were the subject  of a payment agreement that required monthly payments  of  
$39 which she made.  (Tr. 48-52)  Credit reports from  October 2023  and  April 2024  show 
the debt  alleged in SOR  ¶  1.b in collection for  $693. (GE 4 at 3, GE 5 at  2)  A January  
2023 credit report  shows the debt alleged in SOR  ¶  1.i  as in collection for $111.  (GE 3 at  
5)  She did not submit documentary evidence of any payment  on th ese  debts. The 
allegations are resolved for Applicant because she specifically  recalled  making regular  
payments  of $39 on these debts  and neither  debt  is shown on later  credit reports.   
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit collection account for  $5,581. Applicant  denied  this  debt  
stating she did not know what  account i t was associated with. (Answer)  Credit reports  
from January  and October 2023  show this  individual  account was  opened or assigned for  
collection in August 2017 and  in  collection for $5,385 and $5,581, respectively. (GE  3 at  
3, GE 4 at 2)  Applicant testified “I believe that’s the one that has been paid . . .  I have a  
letter [showing it was  paid in February].”  (Tr. 47 -48) She did not submit docum entary  
evidence of any payment  on this  debt. This debt is  not resolved.  
 SOR ¶ 1.d: credit  account  charged off  for $4,376.  Applicant  acknowledged that  
her spouse used her personal information to open this  account to purchase furniture.  
(Answer) She testified  the debt was “still there. I’m not  even sure what it’s for.” (Tr. 49)  
Credit reports from January  and October 2023 show  this  account  was  charged off with a  
balance of  $4,376. (GE 3 at 3, GE  4 at 2) This debt is not resolved.  
SO
R ¶ ¶  1.e-1.f: credit  accounts charged off for $2,416  and $1,180,  
respectively.  Applicant  stated these debts were for fees  incurred after she voluntarily  
relinquished possession of  a vehicle because she  could not  afford  the loan  payments. 
She hopes to resolve these  debts  through a program offered by her employer.  (Answer; 
Tr. 49-50) Credit reports from January  and October 2023  show these  individual  accounts  
were charged off with balances due of  $2,416  and $1,180, respectively. (GE 3 at  4, GE 4  
at 2-3) These debts are not resolved.  
SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.h: credit accounts  charged off for $458  and $680, respectively. 
Applicant  denied  these allegations stating that she was not  aware of these debts  noting  
she hoped to  identify  the source of the debts  through a program  offered by  her employer. 
(Answer; GE  2  at 3, GE 7 at 3 ; Tr. 50-52) Credit  reports from  January  and October 2023  
show these individual  accounts were  opened or assigned in 2017 and 2016 and charged  
off with balances of $458 and $680, respectively.  (GE 3 at 4 -5, GE 4 at 3)  These  debts  
are  not resolved.  
SOR ¶  1.j: o verdue  federal  income taxes of about $11,920 for  TY 2020.   
Applicant admitted the allegation claiming the delinquency was  attributable to her  lack of  
awareness of the tax implications  of early withdrawal  of funds from  her 401K to help pay  
bills during the COVID -19  pandemic. She intends  to hire a tax professional to assist in

filing an amended return but c annot  afford to do so. She reported that  the IRS  applied  
approximately $5,000 from  her refund for  TY 2023 or  TY 2024 to this debt  and that she  
had a letter showing the amount credited .  In  her January 2023 SCA  and  February 2023  
background interview  Applicant claimed she made payments to the  IRS under a payment  
plan. At hearing,  she claimed she recently paid off  the  tax debt  and submitted an undated  
IRS document showing  she did not  owe any  balance for TY 2021 through TY 2024. (AE  
B) She said that she kept records of  her  payments  and acknowledged her understanding  
of various forms  of  documentary evidence that could corroborate her claims  the overdue  
taxes had be en paid. (Answer;  GE 1  at 38-39, GE  2 at  2; Tr.  38, 80-82; AE A, AE B)  
A
pplicant’s federal income tax account transcript for TY 2020 dated August 3, 2023 
shows that additional taxes were accessed after a refund was issued and that Applicant 
owed overdue taxes, interest, and penalties for TY 2020 totaling $11,920. The transcript 
shows that she made two payments on her overdue taxes; a $125 payment on December 
12, 2022 (that was dishonored the same day), and a $150 payment three days later. (GE 
2 at 10- 11) She did not submit documentary evidence of any other payments or of a 
payment plan. This debt is not resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.k:  failed to timely file federal income tax return for TY 2018 and it  
remained unfiled as  of August 6,  2024.  Applicant denied the allegation claiming she  
submitted the income tax return several  times but could not afford a tax professional to  
help resolve the issue.  (Answer) She testified she used commercial software to file the 
return and  was later informed it could n ot be accepted el ectronically. She  said that she  
printed the tax  return and had filed  it  three times but  that the IRS denied receiving it. She 
said she m ay have c opies of documents  proving she  completed and filed the tax return  
but  did not submit any  documentary evidence to support her claims.  (Tr.  34-37, 74-80)  
Applic
ant’s federal income tax account transcript for TY 2018 dated September 7, 
2023, states no income tax return was filed. (GE 2 at 7-8) She did not submit documentary 
evidence showing that she completed, submitted, or filed a TY 2018 federal income tax 
return. 
SOR ¶ 1.l:  failed to timely file state  income tax return for TY 2018.  Applicant  
submitted documentary  evidence that  she filed her TY 2018 state income tax return  in 
March 2020. (GE 2 at  33-35; Tr. 76 -80)  She  timely filed her state income taxes  for TY  
2017, TY 2019, and TY 2020.  (GE  2 at 30-32, 36-41)  She s ubsequently  relocated to a  
state that  does not tax personal  income.  (Tr.  39-40)  
Appli
cant filed her federal income tax return for TY 2016 in August 2018. She also 
failed to pay federal income taxes when due in TY 2016, TY 2017, and TY 2019. Her 
overdue federal income taxes, penalties, and interest for TY 2016 totaling about $10,045 
were paid in April 2021 with credit transferred from her TY 2020 return. Delinquent TY 
2017 taxes totaling about $5,652 were paid in April 2020 with credit transferred from her 
TY 2019 return. Overdue TY 2019 taxes totaling about $1, 439 were paid in April 20 22 
with credit transferred from her TY 2021 return. (GE 2 at 3 -9) At hearing, she indicated 
she would be able to provide documentation that she filed federal income tax returns for 
TY 2023 and TY 2024 but did not do so. (Tr. 37-40) In addition, a July 2025 credit report

shows six debts not alleged in the SOR and totaling more than $8,000 had been charged 
off or placed for collection. (GE 6 at 1-4 ) Applicant testified that she was not aware of 
some of these debts and could submit documentary evidence of payments she made on 
others but did not do so. (Tr. 52-56) These issues were not alleged in the SOR but may 
be considered: 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s  
evi
dence of  extenuation,  mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to  
consider whether an applicant has  demonstrated successful rehabilitation;   
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is  
appli
cable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under  
Directive Section 6.3.  
ISCR Ca
se No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). 
Applicant’s gross annual income including commissions was about $130,000 until 
March 2020. She relocated to another state and earned about $100,000 per year until 
October 2021 because of an unexpected drop in commissions. From October 2021 to 
November 2022, she earned about $120,000. Her income increased to about $135,000 
per year in December 2022, and after a recent raise she currently earns about $150,000 
per year. In an August 2023 personal financial statement, Applicant reported a monthly 
net remainder after expenses of about $800. (GE 2 at 24- 25) She testified her net 
remainder has been reduced to about $400 -$500 per month. She has about $1,900 in 
the bank and about $45,000 in a retirement account . (Tr.32-34, 58-67) She submitted 
evidence that she owed no overdue federal income taxes for TY 2021 through TY 2024. 
(AE B) 
During the hearing Applicant was informed of the importance of providing 
documentary evidence of income tax filings and payments, and efforts to address or 
resolve her other financial issues. (Tr. 7-9, 39, 68-87) 
Policies  
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan , 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
5 
 
 
  
    
 
    
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
     
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
    
 
  
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the appli cant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15- 01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition  by substantial  
evidence,  the burden  shifts to the applicant to rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or  mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of  proving a mitigating condition,  
and the burden of disproving it  never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No.  02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.  22, 2005).  An applicant “has the ultimate burden of  
demonstrating that it is  clearly consistent with the national interest  to grant or continue his 
security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity  
clearance determinations should err, if they  must, on the side of  denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S.  
at 531.   
Analysis  
Guideline F: Financial Considerations  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
6 
 
 
   
  
  
   
  
   
 
   
    
     
    
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
   
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .  An individual who is financially  
overextended is at  greater risk of having to engage in illegal  or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about a person’s self -control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or 
sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
Applicant’s admissions and record evidence, including credit bureau reports and 
tax account transcripts, establish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG 
¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) , AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial 
obligations), and AG ¶ 19(f) (failure to file annual Federal [or] state income tax returns or 
failure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required). 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
under
 such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  probl em were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;   
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;    
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides  evidence of actions  
to resolve the issue;  and  
(g) the individual has  mad e arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
AG ¶
 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s financial problems are longstanding and 
ongoing. She has not shown that her financial problems are unlikely to recur, and h er 
7 
 
 
   
 
 
     
    
   
    
 
      
   
    
 
          
 
      
    
     
 
    
   
   
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
   
    
      
  
      
   
     
     
financial behavior casts doubt on h er current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant’s unexpected loss of commissions 
during the COVID -19 pandemic and her spouse’s medical issues and unemployment 
were conditions largely beyond her control. However, she has not produced sufficient 
evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
AG ¶ ¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are not established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.c-1.h, and 1.k. Applicant has not received financial counseling and there is insufficient 
evidence to conclude she initiated or adhered to a good-faith effort to resolve these debts. 
AG ¶ 20(d) is established for debts totaling $804 alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i. 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1. a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 
1.h, 1.i, or 1.j because Applicant has provided no documentary evidence to substantiate 
a basis to dispute these debts or of actions taken to resolve any issue. 
AG ¶ 20(g) is established for Applicant’s past-due TY 2018 state income tax return 
filed in March 2020. However, it is not established for her unfiled federal income tax return 
for TY 2018, or for overdue federal income taxes for TY 2020 totaling about $11,920. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). I consider ed Applicant’s age, work 
history, and that h er financial problems were caused in part by conditions beyond her 
control. I considered her limited disposable income after expenses , that she resolved 
debts alleged in in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i totaling $804, that she has filed her TY 2018 state 
income tax return , and that she owes no overdue federal income taxes for TY 2021 
through TY 2024. I also considered her delinquent debt not alleged in the SOR and her

evidence to conclude that Applicant has acted responsibly given her circumstances. That 
some of the debts have dropped off recent credit reports is not meaningful evidence of 
debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016). 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts, delinquent income tax 
filing and overdue income taxes. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With a longer track record of financial responsibility, she may be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. Overall, the record evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance at this time. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  
  AGAINST APPLICANT  
Subparagraph:  1.a:   Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.b:   For  Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.c-1.h:   Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.i:   For  Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.j-1.k:   Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.l:   For  Applicant  
Conclusion  
In l ight of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
