Decision 
Dorsey, Benjamin R., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns . The 
personal conduct security concerns were not established. Eligibility for access t o 
classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case   
On October 24, 2024, the Department of Defense (DOD ) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) . He responded to the SOR with an 
answer dated November 15, 2024, and requested a decision based on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing. 
On December 16, 2024, the Government issued an SOR Amendment that added 
additional allegations under Guideline F . On January 17, 2025, Applicant responded to 
the SOR Amendment. 
The Government submitted its written case on January 23, 2025. A complete copy 
of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was advised that 
1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
  
 
 
     
       
    
    
 
     
     
       
    
      
    
  
   
   
 
   
  
    
   
 
   
  
    
    
 
   
 
   
     
    
     
     
     
   
   
he had 30 days from his date of receipt to file objections and submit material to refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on February 
5, 2025, and he did not respond to it. The case was assigned to me on April 10 , 2025. 
The Government exhibits included in the FORM, marked as Items 1 through 10 , are 
admitted in evidence without objection. 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has 
worked as a welder since September 2022. He earned a high school diploma in June 
2008. He has never married and has no children. He served in the Army National Guard 
from 2007 until 2013. (Items 3, 4) 
In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant’s failure to file his federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, as required. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1. a and 1. b). It also alleged Applicant’s four delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $16,2 00 (SOR ¶¶ 1. c through 1. f). These delinquencies consist of the 
following: a loan for car repairs (SOR ¶ 1.c); a car loan (SOR ¶ 1. d); and two 
telecommunications debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f). He admitted the Guideline F SOR 
allegations without additional comment. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. 
The Guideline F SOR allegations are established t hrough his admissions and the 
Government’s evidence. (Items 3-10) 
In his undated interrogatory response to the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA), Applicant claimed that he filed his federal income tax returns for 2017, 
2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023 in March 2024. He claimed that he filed his 2020 
federal and state income tax returns in October 2024. He claimed that he owed $2,136 in 
federal taxes for tax year 2020. He claimed that he filed his state income tax returns for 
tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 in October 2024. He claimed that he 
filed his 2023 state income tax return in March 2024 . He acknowledged owing state 
income taxes in the amount of $1,176; $503; and $286, for tax year 2017, 2018, and 
2019, respectively. The Government did not allege Applicant owing delinquent taxes in 
the SOR, so I will not use it for disqualification purposes. However, I will use that 
information for mitigation purposes and in my whole-person analysis. (Item 4) 
Applicant provided no documentary evidence to corroborate that he filed his 
federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022 . 
He provided a completed IRS Form 4506- T dated January 24, 2024, requesting a copy 
of his income tax transcripts for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. He 
provided a contract between himself and a tax relief company that was executed in June 
2023, whereby the tax relief company agreed to assist him with resolving his federal and 
state income tax issues. He also provided a document that showed that he authorized the 
automatic debit of the $295 fee that the tax resolution company required to investigate 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
    
 
      
      
      
   
      
 
     
   
   
 
   
 
  
   
    
    
    
 
     
        
   
  
  
  
  
     
  
 
    
     
  
  
    
     
   
  
   
   
his tax issues. However, in an undated response to Defense Counterintelligence and 
Security Agency (DCSA) interrogatories issued on October 24, 2023, he acknowledged 
that he stopped working with this tax resolution company on an undisclosed date because 
he could not afford their services. (Items 4, 5) 
The delinquent loan that Applicant claimed was for car repairs listed in SOR ¶ 1.c 
in the approximate amount of $7,295 has not been resolved. Applicant believed that he 
only borrowed about $980 on this account and thought he paid it off . He did not provide 
any documentation regarding this debt. The debt appears on the 2023 credit report but 
not on the 2024 or 2025 credit report. (Items 4, 5, 8) 
The delinquent car loan listed in SOR ¶ 1. d in the approximate amount of $5,996 
was being resolved, but there is insufficient evidence to show that the resolution 
continued after about April 2024. Applicant opened this account to finance the purchase 
of a car in 2017. He became delinquent on the account in about November 2019. In April 
2023, after receiving a settlement letter from the creditor, he agreed to pay a settlement 
amount of $1,944 in $40 monthly payments from April 2023 until March 2027. He provided 
no documentary evidence to show that he made those payments. The May 2023 credit 
report reflects a balance of $6,441 and the April 2024 credit report reflects a balance of 
$5,996, so the evidence reflects that he has made some payments on this debt. However, 
the evidence does not reflect any payments since about April 2024. This debt does not 
appear on the January 2025 credit report. (Items 4, 5, 8, 9) 
The delinquent telecommunication debt listed in SOR ¶ 1. e in the approximate 
amount of $1,721 has not been resolved. Applicant opened this account in about 2016 
as a carrier for his cell phone. He stopped using the account in 2020 because he claimed 
the service was poor. He claimed that he cancelled the account in 2020, and the creditor 
did not notify him that he owed money on the account. During his June 2023 security 
interview, he told the DOD investigator that he would look into the account and have it 
paid off by the end of 2023. He provided no documentary evidence regarding this account. 
The account appears on the 2023 credit report, but not the 2024 or 2025 credit reports. 
(Items 4, 5, 8) 
The delinquent telecommunications debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.f in the approximate 
amount of $1,206 has not been resolved. Applicant opened this cable account in 2017 
and stopped using it in 2019, when he and his ex-girlfriend stopped seeing one another. 
Applicant claimed he canceled the account in 2019. He does not know whether the 
account balance is for unused equipment or cable service and claimed the creditor has 
not notified him that he owed money on the account. During his June 2023 security 
interview, he told the DOD investigator that he would look into the account and have it 
paid off by the end of 2023. He provided no documentary evidence regarding this account. 
The account appears on the 2023 credit report and 2025 credit report, but not the 2024 
credit report. (Items 4, 5, 8, 10)

Applicant satisfied two judgments against him that were not listed in the SOR. One 
was a judgment in detinue for possession of furniture and damages in the amount of 
$2,299 entered against him in 2015. He satisfied that judgment in 2016. The other was a 
judgment for damages in the amount of $2,290 entered against him in 2019. He satisfied 
this judgment partially through a wage garnishment in March 2023. (Items 3, 6, 7) 
Applicant’s financial delinquencies were caused by intermittent periods of 
unemployment between September 2019 and August 2022, and his breakup with his 
girlfriend in 2019. With respect to his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns, 
he claimed that he did not timely file them because he thought his mother was filing them 
as she had done in the past. He also claimed that he failed to pick up his IRS W -2 form 
for tax year 2021, because he was unemployed. In his undated response to DCSA 
interrogatories, he provided a personal financial statement wherein he wrote that he had 
about $415 in surplus funds at the end of each month. He has not provided any more 
recent budget information or evidence to show his current financial status. He provided 
no evidence that he has undergone financial counseling. (Items 3-5) 
Despite being required to divulge his failure to file his federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022 on the 2023 security clearance 
application (SCA), Applicant failed to do so. The Government alleged these failures to 
divulge this information on the SCA under Guideline E, claiming that he deliberately 
omitted that information. Applicant divulged his failure to file his federal income tax return 
for tax year 2021 on the SCA. He claimed that he did not list his additional federal and 
state income tax filing deficiencies because he did not realize he had to look back that 
many years and noted that he volunteered this information to the DOD investigator during 
the June 2023 security interview. In the SCA, h e divulged the delinquent debt listed in 
SOR ¶ 1.d and the delinquency that resulted in the judgment for damages that I 
referenced above. 
Policies  
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. 
When evaluating an applicant ’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a f iduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness , and ability to 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
   
  
   
   
 
  
    
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a)  inability to satisfy  deb
 ts;  
(b)  a history  of  not  meeting financial obligations;  and  
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
t
ax returns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income  tax as  
required.  
Appl
icant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 
2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, as required. He had four delinquent debts totaling 
about $16,200. The above disqualifying conditions are established. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
und
er such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  pr oblem were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;     
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- f aith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
(e) the individual has  a r easonable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue; and

(g) the individual has  m ade arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.   
Fail
ure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
abiding by well -established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with 
rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case 
No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or 
her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 
16, 2018). 
It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution 
of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). While 
Applicant claimed that he has filed his delinquent federal and state tax returns and his 
2023 federal and state tax return, he provided no documentary evidence to corroborate 
these filings. Therefore, I find that he has not provided sufficient evidence that he has 
filed those income tax returns. 
To the extent that Applicant claimed that he was resolving the delinquencies in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f, the only documentation he provided was a payment  agreement 
on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, without proof of payments made. As I noted above, the balance 
on this debt was about $450 lower on the 2024 credit report compared to the 2023 credit 
report, but there is no documentary evidence to show any additional payments or a more 
recent balance. 
If Applicant disputed any of the SOR debts because he thought the balance was 
too high (SOR ¶ 1.c) or he did not know he had an outstanding balance (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 
1.f), these are reasonable bases to dispute a debt. However, he did not provide 
documentation to substantiate the basis of any dispute, nor did he provide evidence of 
action he took to resolve the dispute such as calling the creditor or the credit reporting 
agencies. In June 2023, he claimed that he would contact the creditor of the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.e and 1.f, but he provided no evidence that he followed through. 
I note that Applicant satisfied two judgments not alleged in the SOR, but one of 
these was at least partially satisfied through an involuntary wage garnishment , and the 
other was satisfied through unknown sources in 2016, well before he had additional and 
subsequent financial issues. Additionally, I note that some of the delinquent debts no 
longer appear on the 2024 or 2025 credit reports. However, a myriad of reasons that do 
not involve mitigating resolution can cause accounts to drop off subsequent credit reports. 
It is Applicant’s burden to show that the reason that debts no longer appear on a credit 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
  
   
    
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
    
    
   
 
 
   
   
  
 
    
  
  
 
  
   
       
    
 
 
  
 
    
   
 
report is a result of a mitigative action. He has not met that burden with respect to these 
debts. 
For these reasons, I do not find that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence to 
show that any of the mitigating factors apply to his failure to file his income tax returns or 
his SOR delinquencies. 
Guideline E,  Personal Conduct   
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national 
security investigative or adjudicative processes. 
AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment,  or falsification of relevant facts from  
any personnel  security questionnaire, personal  history  statement,  or similar  
form  used to conduct  investigations, determine employment qualifications,  
award benefits  or status, determine security clearance eligibility or  
trustworthiness,  or award fiduciary responsibilities.   
I do not find that Applicant’s failure to divulge his failure to file his federal and state 
income tax returns on the SCA as indicated in the SOR was deliberate. He divulged his 
failure to file his federal income tax return for tax year 2021 on the SCA. He divulged other 
derogatory financial information on the SCA. He freely discussed the full extent of his 
income tax filing failings during the June 2023 security interview. I find this behavior 
inconsistent with someone who is trying to hide his tax issues. Therefore, I find that there 
is insufficient evidence that his omission was deliberate. AG ¶ 16(a) does not apply and 
Guideline E is not established. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):

________________________ 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this case. I have considered Applicant’s military service. I have incorporated 
my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concern . The personal conduct security 
concern was not established. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  
  AGAI
NST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f:   Against Applicant 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:  FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:  For Applicant 
Conclusion  
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
