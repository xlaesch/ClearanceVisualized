Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On July 6, 2023 , Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On August 16, 2024, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A, the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 
2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) did not find under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended 
1 
 
 
 
 
     
  
   
    
      
 
  
         
   
       
     
 
 
   
 
 
   
  
    
 
   
  
 
   
  
   
  
 
 
     
     
   
  
 
   
    
  
   
    
  
       
   
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising 
under Guideline F. (HE 2) On October 19, 2024, Applicant provided his response to the 
SOR. (HE 3) On December 2, 202 4, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
December 11, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On December 13, 2024, DOHA issued 
a notice setting the hearing for February 20, 202 5. (HE 1) The hearing was held as 
scheduled. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant did not offer any exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 11, 18-20; GE 1-GE 7) All proffered 
exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. On March 3, 202 5, DOHA 
received a copy of the transcript. He did not provide any post -hearing appearance 
exhibits. The record closed on April 21, 2025. (Tr. 58. 63)   
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.n, except for SOR ¶ 1.m . (Tr. 14) He also provided extenuating and mitigating 
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
Applicant is 51 years old, and he has been a customer service representative since 
June of 2023. (Tr. 7- 8) In 1992, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) He has a few 
college credits, and he has not received a degree. (Tr. 7) He has not served in the military. 
(Tr. 7) His annual salary is about $38,000 (rounded to nearest $1,000). (Tr. 8, 23 ) 
Applicant has been married four times. (Tr. 9) He was divorced in 1999, 2006, and 2013. 
(GE 1) He was most recently married in September of 2024. (Tr. 9) His daughter is 28 
years old. (Tr. 10) 
Financial Considerations  
Applicant said his credit score improved on his most recent credit bureau reports 
(CBRs), which is an indication he was making efforts to improve his credit and finances. 
(Tr. 21-23, 45; GE 4, GE 7) He wanted to eventually be able to purchase a home. (Tr. 45) 
He received a $1-an-hour wage increase about 11 months ago to $22 an hour. (Tr. 24) 
Applicant was employed for 14 years working for a cable company until he lost his 
employment in October 2018, and he was unable to find new employment due to the 
COVID 19 pandemic and business reorganizations. (Tr. 32- 35) He was underemployed 
for a time or briefly employed for several years . (Tr. 35-38) His spouse is disabled, and 
they are in the process of applying for disability payments for her. (Tr. 25) His spouse has 
two children aged 14 and 17 who live in Applicant’s household and have special needs. 
His spouse receives $500 monthly of child support. (Tr. 26) Applicant has unreimbursed 
medical expenses. (Tr. 27) The children are on Medicaid or Medicare. (Tr. 28-29) He pays 
2 
 
 
 
   
 
  
   
    
    
     
 
  
     
    
   
   
      
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
    
   
   
 
 
  
 
   
   
   
$150 monthly for his own prescriptions. (Tr. 28) His spouse’s medications are covered by 
insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. (Tr. 28-29) He does not use a written budget. (Tr. 29) 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 31) He uses financial software 
to track his finances. (Tr. 29-30) At the end of each month after paying his expenses, he 
has a remainder of about $250. (Tr. 30) He has about $500 in his checking account, 
nothing in his savings account, and no 401(k) retirement account. (Tr. 32) He agreed that 
the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.c through 1.n were his accounts. (Tr. 48, 57) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to file as required his federal and state 
income tax returns for tax year (TY) 20 20, and his state income tax return for TY 2021, 
respectively. At the time of his hearing, Applicant had not filed his TY 2020 federal and 
state income tax returns and his state tax return for TY 2021. (Tr. 40, 42) He said he did 
not file his tax returns because he did not have a W2 form from his employer. (Tr. 40) He 
was relying on the IRS to prepare a substitute federal income tax return for him. (Tr. 41) 
Applicant had delinquent taxes from TY 2019. (Tr. 42, 53 ) The IRS intercepted 
refunds for other years and used the refunds to pay his TY 2019 tax bill. (Tr. 42, 54) 
Applicant’s IRS tax  transcript for TY 2020 shows “no tax return filed.” (GE  5 at 21-
22) His IRS tax transcript for TY  2021 indicates his  tax return was  timely filed,  and no  
taxes are owed;  however, it indicates  his income was $0. (GE  5 at 19- 20)  His IRS ta x 
transcript for TY 2022  shows his tax return was filed on December  4, 2023;  his adjusted  
gross income was about  $44,000 (rounded to nearest $1,000),  and  zero taxes are owed.  
(GE 5 at 18-19)   
SOR ¶¶  1.c  through  1.j  allege Applicant  has  eight accounts placed  for collection  
for  about $774, $962,  $612,  $1,304,  $737, $173, $677, and $1,604.  respectively. SOR ¶¶ 
1.k through 1.n has four charged- off accounts for about  $818,  $476, $720, and $1,604,  
respectively.  
The balance of  Applicant’s  SOR ¶ 1.f account was $4,304; however, the SOR  
alleged $1,304. (Tr. 47) The accounts  in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.j were  opened from about  
2018  and to about  2023, and became delinquent  from  about 2021 to abo ut 2024.  (Tr. 42-
51) He did not  make any payments to any of  the SOR creditors. (Tr. 43, 45, 48, 50)  
Applicant’s February 13, 2025 CBR lists all of the SOR debts as delinquent except 
for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($774), 1.h ($173), and 1.l ($476) , which do not appear on 
this CBR. (GE 7) 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
3 
 
 
    
 
 
     
     
 
 
  
  
   
    
 
   
 
  
 
  
   
  
   
   
   
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition  by substantial  
evidence,  the burden  shifts to the applicant to rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or  mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶  E3.1.15. An applicant “has  the ultimate burden of  demonstrating that it  
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant  or continue his [or  her] security  
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of  
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at  5 (App. Bd.  Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if  
they  must, on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts,  and meet financial  
obligations may  indicate poor  self-control, lack of judgment, or  
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise  
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to  
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial  distress can  also  be 
caused or exacerbated by,  and thus can be a possible indicator of, other  
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,  mental  
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An  
individual who is financially overe xtended is at greater risk of having to  
engage in illegal  or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for  the financial  
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No.  11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May  1,  2012)  
(citation omitted) as follows:  
This concern is broader than the possibility that  an applicant might  
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in  
satisfaction of  his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the  
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge  
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control,  
judgment,  and other qualities  essential to protecting the national secrets as  
well as  the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct  under any of the Guidelines  
and an applicant’s  security  eligibility.  
AG ¶ 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: 
(a) inability to satisfy  debt
 s;  
(c) a history of not  mee ting financial  obligations;  and 
(f) fail
ure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
T
he record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions are contained in the mitigation section, infra. 
5 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
    
  
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  s o infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  probl em were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear   
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or identity theft),  and the   
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay   
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;     
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue; and  
(g) the i
ndividual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance  
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or  maintenance of  
a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown,  913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  
Cir. 1990),  cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government  
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts  to the 
applicant to rebut or  mitigate those concerns.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The  
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is  that  articulated in  
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access  
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
Directive, Enclosure 2  ¶ 2(b).  
Applicant provided some important mitigating information. He had periods of 
unemployment and underemployment, and his spouse and children had medical 
6 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
      
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
 
problems. These issues adversely affected his finances. However, “[e]ven if [an 
applicant’s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the 
applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial 
difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 
25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). Applicant did not provide 
enough details to prove he acted reasonably and responsibly under all the circumstances. 
Applicant failed to file as required his federal and state income tax returns for TY 
2020 and his state income tax return for TY 2021. He did not indicate he filed his overdue 
tax returns at his hearing. 
Recently, the Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 23 -00254 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 
2024) said: 
A security clearance adjudication is not  a proceeding aimed at inducing an  
applicant to meet his  or her duty to file tax  returns. Rather, it is  a proceeding  
aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  
E.g., ISCR Case No.  07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul.  22,  2008). Accordingly,  
even though Applicant eventually filed his  tax returns  [in the case under  
appeal], the Judge was obligated to consider the facts  and circumstances  
surrounding the failure to timely  meet tax obligations.  Id.  
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. § 7203, 
willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: 
Any person . . . required by this  title or by regulations  made under authority  
thereof to make a return, keep any records,  or supply  any information, who 
willfully fails to . . .   make such return, keep such records, or supply such  
information, at the time or  times required by law or regulations,  shall, in  
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor. . .  .  
A willful failure to make return, keep records,  or supply information when required,  
is a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of  any tax liability.  Spies v. United  
States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943);  United States v.  Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9
th  Cir. 1973);  United  
States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969);  O’Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  
Cir. 1931).  For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely  
file his federal income tax returns against him as a crime.  Regarding  the failure to timely  
file a federal income tax return,  the Appeal  Board has commented:  
F
ailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has  a problem with  
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary  
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.  ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not  directed at collecting  
7 
 
 
 
 
    
  
  
  
   
    
 
      
        
 
 
    
     
debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at  5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By  
the same token,  neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax  
returns. Rather, it is  a proceeding aimed  at  evaluating an applicant’s  
judgment and reliability.  Id.  A person who fails repeatedly  to fulfill his  or her  
legal obligations does  not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment  
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  
See, e.g., ISCR Case  No. 14-01894 at 5 (App.  Bd. Aug.  18, 2015).  See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local  473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173,  
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960),  aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  
ISCR Case No.  14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.  15, 2016) (emphasis in original).  See  ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at  4 (App. Bd. June 15,  2016) (citations omitted); ISCR  Case No. 14-
05476 at 5 (App.  Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No.  01-05340 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec.  
20,  2002)); ISCR Case No.  14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18,  2015). The Appeal Board  
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly  corrected [his or her]  
federal tax problem,  and the fact that [applicant] is now  motivated to prevent such  
problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security  
worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility ,” 
including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.  See  ISCR Case No.  15-01031  
at 3 & n.3 ( App.  Bd.  June 1 5, 2016)  (characterizing “no harm,  no foul” approach to an  
applicant’s  course of conduct and e mploying an “all’s  well that ends  well” analysis as  
inadequate to support  approval of  access to classified information with focus on timing of  
filing of  tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) explained 
that in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, 
grant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In that case , the applicant filed 
his 2011 federal income tax return in December 2013, his 2012 federal tax return in 
September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in October 2015. He received federal 
tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. Nevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the 
administrative judge’s decision to grant access to classified information. Id. 
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG ¶ 20(g) applied, and noted: 
The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important  factor in  
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who  
begins to resolve financial problems  only after being placed on notice that  
his clearance was in jeopardy  may lack the judgment  and self-discipline to  
follow rules  and regulations over time or when there is  no immediate threat  
to his own interests. In this case, applicant’s filing of his  [f]ederal income tax  
returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background  
interview,  or receiving the SOR  undercuts the weight such remedial action  
might  otherwise merit.  
In this case, Applicant’s SOR listed 12 delinquent accounts. His February 13, 2025 
CBR lists all of the SOR debts as delinquent except for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($774),

1.h ($173
), and 1.l ($476), which do not appear on this credit report. “[T]hat some debts 
have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” 
ISCR Case No. 14 -05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14- 03612 
at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most 
negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency 
or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever 
is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon 
dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely 
respond to a credit reporting company’s request for information, or when the debt has 
been charged off. 
“[U]ntil an applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as a 
matter of law that he has initiated a good- faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolved debts. The phrase ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes 
evidence of actual debt reduction through payment on debts.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007)). 
Applicant did not provide evidence that he maintained contact with several of his 
creditors. He does not have a payment plan to address most of his delinquent debts, and 
he has not made any payments to his SOR creditors. I am not confident that he will 
establish payment plans, pay, or otherwise resolve these SOR debts, and maintain his 
financial responsibility. Under all the circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions fully 
apply to the SOR allegations. Financial considerations security concerns are not 
mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment.

Applicant is 51 years old, and he has been a customer service representative since 
June of 2023. In 1992, he graduated from high school. He has a few college credits, and 
he has not received a degree. His annual salary is about $38,000 (rounded to nearest 
$1,000). He said his credit score improved from the dates of his two most recent CBRs, 
which is an indication that he was making efforts to improve his credit and finances. He 
received a $1-an-hour wage increase about 11 months ago to $22 an hour , which is an 
indication that he is a good employee. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations section, supra, and the evidence against mitigation is more persuasive . 
Applicant did not establish that he was making payments to his SOR creditors or that he 
is establishing payment plans to address his SOR debts. He failed to timely file his federal 
and state income tax returns for TY 2020 and his state income tax return for TY 2021. His 
failure to take timely, prudent, responsible, and good-faith actions regarding his taxes and 
other debts raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability 
to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. 
See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. “[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record 
discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.” ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case 
No.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards resolution of his tax and delinquent debt issues, he may well be 
able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns.

_________________________ 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT   
Subparagraphs  1.a through 1.n:  Against Applicant  
Conclusion  
Considering all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
