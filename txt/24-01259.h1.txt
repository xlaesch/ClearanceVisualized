Decision 
BORGSTROM, Eric H., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate the foreign influence and financial considerations 
security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement  of the Case  
On September 20, 2024 , the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns 
under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline F (financial considerations) . The 
DCSA acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) ; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
In Applicant’s October 11, 2024 response to the SOR (Answer), he admitted, with 
explanations, SOR ¶¶ 1.a.-1.d., and he denied SOR ¶ 2.a. He attached seven exhibits , 
which he marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G. He requested a hearing before 
a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. (Answer) 
 
 
  
   
   
    
    
  
 
  
  
  
   
 
   
 
  
    
 
     
 
       
   
 
 
    
  
 
   
   
  
    
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
   
    
  
   
 
  
      
       
On December 12, 2024, the Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. I was 
assigned this case on April 10, 2025. On June 5, 2025, DOHA issued a notice scheduling 
the hearing for July 7, 2025, by video teleconference. The hearing proceeded as 
scheduled. The Government proffered two evidentiary exhibits, which I admitted as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, without objection. The Government also offered 
materials for administrative notice as to the security concerns regarding Kenya , which I 
admitted for administrative notice (AN I). Applicant testified and proffered 10 exhibits, 
which I admitted as AE A through J, without objection. At Applicant’s request, I held the 
record open until August 7, 2025. I received the hearing transcript on July 17, 2025. Due 
to technical difficulties in transmitting and receiving the post-hearing submissions , 
Applicant’s 25 post-hearing exhibits were not received until September 18, 2025, and I 
admitted them into evidence as AE K through AE II, without objection. The record closed 
on September 18, 2025. 
Findings of Fact  
Applicant is 45 years old. He was born in Kenya, where he graduated from high 
school in 1999 and earned an associate degree in 2007. He married his first wife in Kenya 
in 2009, and they had three children. They separated in 2013 and divorced in 2014. He 
married his second wife, a U.S. citizen, in April 2015. His three children from his first 
marriage, now ages 18, 14, and 11, reside with him and his second wife in the United 
States. He also has a two-year-old child from another relationship, and this child does not 
reside with him. (GE 1, GE 3; AE F, AE HH; Tr. 26-31) 
From August 2003 to September 2007, Applicant served in the Kenyan Army as 
an aircraft mechanic. He achieved the rank of senior private. He entered the United States 
in November 2007, trained for a month with a DOD contractor, and then returned 
overseas as a full-time employee of that DOD contractor. Between December 2007 and 
about 2013, he worked for a DOD contractor in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Africa, and he 
spent little time in the United States. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2021. 
(GE 1; AE D, AE E, AE HH; Tr. 27-29) 
From August 2015 to December 2017, Applic ant was employed as an industrial 
waste technician for a private company in the United States. From December 2017 to 
February 2019, he was a hazardous materials truck driver. He voluntarily left this 
employment due to injuries suffered from a vehicle accident unrelated to his employment. 
From March 2019 to January 2022, he was employed full time as a hazardous materials 
technician and truck driver for a private company. From February 2022 to September 
2024, Applicant was employed as a lead mechanic for a DOD contractor, and he was 
stationed overseas. He has had not security violations while employed as a DOD 
contractor. Since December 2024, he has been working as a senior generator technician 
for a private company in the United States. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 24, 50-51) 
The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s parents 
and four brothers, who are citizens and residents of Kenya (SOR ¶ 1.a.); three of his 
brothers who serve in the Kenyan Army (SOR ¶ 1.b.); his sister who is a citizen of Kenya

(SOR ¶ 1.c.); and his best friend and cousin who are citizens of and reside in Kenya (SOR 
¶ 1.d.). Applicant admitted all of these foreign contacts in his Answer. (Answer) 
Foreign Influence  
SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant’s parents are citizens of Kenya. They reside in a rural village 
in Kenya. His father served for approximately 37 years in the Kenyan Army, as a cook, 
and he retired as a sergeant. He currently receives a military pension. Both of Applicant’s 
parents are now retired and live on an ancestral farm. Applicant has monthly telephonic 
contact with his father, who is in declining health. He speaks with his mother once or twice 
a week. He provides approximately $150-200 a month in financial support to his parents. 
(GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 33-37, 44, 48) 
 Applicant’s three eldest children were born in Kenya. They  obtained  U.S. legal  
permanent resident (LPR) status  in about 2021, after Applicant became a naturalized  
U.S. citizen. His children  resided with Applicant’s  parents from 2014 to 2021 in Kenya  
before moving to live with Applicant and his  second wife in the United States.  The 
children’s mother died in 2018,  and their maternal grandparents reside in Kenya.  (GE 1, 
GE 3; Tr. 30, 50)  
SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant has four brothers, who are citizens and residents of Kenya, 
with whom he maintains telephonic and electronic (texts and emails) contact 
approximately once every month or two months. All four brothers are married. Brothers 
#1, #2, and #4 currently serve in the Kenyan Army as sergeants. Brother #3 is a farmer 
and resides with Applicant’s parents.  (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 35, 37, 46) 
SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant’s one sister is a citizen of Kenya, and she resides in the 
United States. She maintains U.S. LPR status. Applicant has weekly in- person, 
telephonic, and electronic contact with her. She is employed as a caregiver, and she is 
married. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32) 
SOR ¶ 1.d. Applicant’s best friend and his cousin are both citizens and residents 
of Kenya. Neither is employed by the Kenyan government or military. Applicant has 
contacts with these individuals about twice a year. (GE 3; Tr. 38-39) 
Applicant traveled to Kenya for lengthy trips to visit his family in April 2016, August 
2017, February 2018, April 2019, January 2021, May 2021, and June 2022. He has 
constructed a home on his parents’ property where he stays during his visits. He 
estimated the value of the home as approximately $20,000. In June 2024, Applicant, his 
wife, and his three eldest children traveled to Kenya to visit family, including his children’s 
maternal grandparents. (GE 3; Tr. 40-42, 53) 
Financial Considerations  
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent Federal income taxes on his January 
2023 security clearance application (SCA). In April 2023, he was interviewed three times 
3 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
     
   
 
  
    
   
 
    
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
    
   
 
  
    
 
 
 
 
   
     
    
 
 
 
      
     
     
by an authorized investigator on behalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). 
During those interviews, he admitted that he had received correspondence from the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2021 about miscalculations and tax liabilities for tax 
years (TY) 2019 and 2020. He claimed to have established an IRS installment agreement 
and to have engaged a tax -resolution firm (TRF) to negotiate a settlement with the IRS. 
He explained that he had supplemented his income by driving for two ride- share 
companies between 2016 and January 2022. His tax preparer had listed his vehicle 
expenses and his mileage as business expenses, essentially double counting, on the TY 
2019 and TY 2020 returns, leading to the miscalculation of his Federal income tax liability. 
(GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 56-59) 
In November 2023, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant and his wife in the 
approximate amount of $59,494 for TY 2019, 2020, and 2021. (GE 3) 
On January 30, 2024, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories regarding his 
delinquent Federal income taxes. He claimed to have timely filed his income tax returns 
but that his tax preparer had incorrectly calculated his tax liability: 
I have always  filed my taxes  every year.  Problem occured [sic] when my  
taxes were filed wrongly because I was working and doing Uber at the same  
time. My account ant  claimed my  expenses and uber mileage all together  
instead of claiming one of the two. This was  done continuously from 2020,  
2021, and 2022 until IRS caught it.   
He added that he had engaged a company to appeal his Federal tax liability with the IRS. 
He was also prepared to commit to paying $1,000 monthly to the IRS beginning in January 
2024.  (GE 2) 
At the hearing, Applicant testified that, after he received correspondence from the 
IRS, he engaged a total of four TRFs; however, he only provided engagement 
documentation for one firm (TRF2) and only demonstrated payments to one firm (TRF 1). 
Applicant admitted that he was uncertain what actions TRF1 would perform on his behalf, 
and he later felt that he had been scammed by TRF1. There is no evidence in the record 
as to the scope of TRF1’s engagement. His checking account statements for January to 
June 2022 show 10 payments totaling approximately $9,300 to a company he identified 
as TRF1. (AE L-O, S, BB; Tr. 60-61) 
There is documentary evidence of a $225 payment to the IRS in March 2022, and 
the above payments were made to TRF1. There is no evidence of any payments to the 
IRS or TRF1 between July 2022 and January 2024. On January 10, 2024, Applicant 
engaged a second tax -resolution firm (TRF2) to “mediate all communications” with tax 
revenue authorities on Applicant’s behalf. The engagement letter does not specifically 
discuss negotiating IRS installment agreements. Rather, TRF2 correspondence notes 
that it is critical for its clients to maintain all payments and compliance with the IRS. As of 
January 23, 2024, Applicant owed $62,604 to the IRS for TY 2019, 2020, and 2021. TRF2 
noted that if Applicant was struggling to pay his current IRS installment agreement, he 
4 
 
 
    
      
   
  
 
   
 
   
      
   
  
  
    
 
 
   
    
     
   
  
     
     
   
   
    
 
    
  
 
    
   
    
  
    
   
   
    
  
  
       
  
   
 
    
   
 
could provide documentation to TRF2 for an alternative resolution. By email dated 
January 29, 2024, Applicant queried TRF 2 if he could start making payments directly to 
the IRS. There is no evidence of any payments made to TRF2, and payments to the IRS 
began in February 2024. (AE K, AE P, AE FF) 
As of July 18, 2024, TRF2 was working on “extended holds against enforced 
collection actions while [it] work[s] with [Applicant} to obtain the requested financial 
information in order to proceed with resolution of the taxes owed.” TRF2 also sought an 
additional $2,000 for its anticipated services. There is no evidence that Applicant paid the 
$2,000 and continued working with TRF 2. Applicant testified that he believed he “fell into 
a scam” with TRF2 because he was paying $600 to TRF2 and no monies were being paid 
to the IRS. There is no evidence that Applicant remained engaged with TRF2 beyond July 
2024, and he testified that he only worked with TRF2 about six months. (AE Q; Tr. 58, 
63-64) 
On October 15, 2024, Applicant agreed to a new installment plan with the IRS, 
under which he would pay $300 monthly to resolve his delinquent taxes, penalties, and 
interest for TY 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2023. Payments were to begin on November 28, 
2024. Applicant testified that he made the required payments in November and December 
2024; however, he provided no corroborating evidence. He provided documentary 
evidence of $300 payments to the IRS in January 2025 and March 2025, and two $300 
payments after the hearing. At the hearing, He also testified to other payments to the IRS 
since 2022 that are not reflected in the documentary evidence. As of July 29, 2025, 
Applicant owed $55,774 to the IRS – TY 2019 ($0), TY 2020 ($9,088), TY 2021 ($38,547), 
and TY 2023 ($8,139). (AE G, AE H, AE U-AA; Tr. 58-64, 72-73) 
TY 2018. The IRS account transcript reflects that he timely filed his return, and he 
owes no taxes for this tax year. (GE 3 at 23) 
TY 2019. The IRS account transcript reflects that he timely filed his return. In 
February 2020, the IRS issued Applicant a refund of $3,992. Upon reexamination by the 
IRS, he was assessed taxes, penalties, and interest totaling approximately $6,095 as of 
August 2022. Applicant made payments in February 2024 ($457), February 2024 ($500), 
February 2024 ($500), and March 2024 ($500). As of September 27, 2024, Applicant 
owed approximately $3,862 in taxes, penalties, and interest for TY 2019. With the October 
5, 2024 IRS installment agreement, the penalties were waived. As of July 29, 2025, 
Applicant owed no balance for TY 2019. This debt is resolved. (Answer; GE 3 at 25-27; 
AE B, AE C, AE G-I, AE U-AA; Tr. 66) 
TY 2020. The IRS account transcript reflects that Applicant timely filed his return. 
In April 2021, a refund of $6,554 was issued to him . Upon recalculation by the IRS, he 
was assessed taxes, penalties, and interest totaling approximately $22,109 as of July 
2023. A $225 payment was made in March 2022. An IRS installment agreement was 
established in October 2023, but no payments were made. As of September 27, 2024, 
Applicant owed approximately $24,935 in taxes, penalties, and interest for TY 2020. On 
October 5, 2024, Applicant entered into a new IRS installment agreement, to pay $300 
5 
 
 
   
      
 
       
 
    
  
     
   
     
   
    
 
      
   
   
    
        
 
 
   
  
   
 
   
 
 
    
    
  
  
 
    
  
  
monthly to resolve his delinquent taxes. As of July 29, 2025, he owed approximately 
$9,088 for TY 2020. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3 at 28-29; AE B, AE G-I, AE U-AA) 
TY 2021. The IRS account transcript reflects that Applicant timely filed his return. 
Two refunds, totaling $16,810, were issued in early 2022. Upon recalculation by the IRS, 
Applicant was assessed taxes, penalties, and interest totaling approximately $32,027 as 
of July 2023. An installment agreement was established in October 2023; however, no 
payments have been applied to this tax year since February 2022. As of September 27, 
2024, Applicant owed approximate $35,837 in taxes, penalties, and interest for TY 2021. 
On October 5, 2024, he entered into a new IRS install ment agreement, to pay $300 
monthly to resolve his delinquent taxes. As of July 29, 2025, he owed approximately 
$38,547 for TY 2021. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3 at 30-31; AE B, AE G-I; AE U-AA) 
TY 2022. The IRS account transcript reports that Applicant timely filed his return, 
which reflected a household annual income of $8,959 for TY 2022. The account transcript 
reflects payments in March 2024 ($500), April 2024 ($600), May 2024 ($500), May 2024 
($400), and June 2024 ($500) which were redirected to Applicant’s TY 2019 tax debt. He 
does not owe any delinquent taxes for TY 2022. (Answer; GE 3 at 32-33; AE C, AE I) 
Applicant testified that he and his wife spent approximately $9,000 for an 
immigration attorney to have his three children obtain LPR status and move to the United 
States. Applicant’s wife had entered an alcohol rehabilitation facility about two weeks prior 
to the security clearance hearing. Although health insurance covered the treatment cost, 
Applicant paid for her out -of-state transportation and has lost her income during 
treatment. (Tr. 67, 74) 
Applicant earns $25 an hour as a senior generator technician. His wife is a full -
time caregiver. As of the hearing, he had approximately $300 in his savings account, and 
he and his wife were past due on some of their credit -card accounts. He explained that 
he started getting behind on his bills beginning in September 2024, when he returned for 
his overseas employment. He felt that he had been scammed by three TRFs, and he 
acknowledged poor decision-making in engaging and paying these companies without a 
clear scope and demonstrated progress. (Tr. 69-70, 75-82) 
6 
 TY 2023.  Applicant’s  IRS account transcript reflects that  he  timely filed his return,  
which reflected  his  and his wife’s gross  income of $90,302.  The account transcript  reflects  
insufficient tax withholding.  Applicant  made payments in July 2024 ($500) and August  
2024 ($550).  He provided documentation of  two scheduled payments, totaling $500, for  
September  2024;  however, there is no documentary  evidence that  these payments  were 
completed.  As of August 27, 2024, he owed approximately $9,761 in taxes, penalties,  
and interest.  On October 5, 2024, Applicant entered into a new IRS installment  
agreement, to pay  $300 monthly to resolve his delinquent taxes.  As of July 29, 2025, he  
owed approximately  $8,139 for TY 2023.  (Answer;  GE 3 at 34-35; AE C, AE  G-I, AE U-
AA)  
 
 
  
 
 
     
   
 
 
    
 
   
    
   
     
 
  
 
 
 
   
   
  
 
   
 
 
    
  
   
  
 
  
  
 
    
  
    
 
 
    
  
  
      
   
On August 1, 2025, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement with his 
monthly income and monthly expenses. With his wife’s income, the monthly household 
income totaled $6,527, and the monthly expenses were approximately $6,283, leaving a 
monthly remainder of approximately $244. His monthly expenses include financial 
support ($300) for his fourth child. (AE GG; Tr. 47, 75-80) 
Whole Person  
Applicant proffered a letter of appreciation from the U.S. Air Force service member 
with whom Applicant worked for five months in 2022. He praised the team’s “infallible 
work ethic and attention to detail.” Applicant received a certificate of appreciation for his 
service supporting the U.S. military overseas as a contractor from December 2007 to 
November 2011. He has completed several security trainings in October and November 
2023. (AE J, AE R, AE T, AE CC, AE DD, AE II) 
Administrative Notice  
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Kenya 
excerpted from the materials proffered by Department Counsel: 
Kenya is a constitutional republic in eastern Africa. In June 2024, the U.S. 
President designated Kenya a major non- NATO ally. The U.S. Department of State has 
issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory for Kenya, advising U.S. travelers to exercise increased 
caution due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping. Certain border counties and 
coastal areas near Somalia, due to terrorism and kidnapping, have even more heightened 
warnings. (AN I) 
Terrorist threats remain high in Kenya. Al -Shabaab is a Sunni Islamic terrorist 
group that publicly pledged loyalty to al Qaeda in 2012. The group works to overthrow the 
Somali government. In January 2023, Al -Shabaab forces attacked U.S. and Kenyan 
forces at a forward operating base in Kenya near the Kenya-Somalia border. In its Annual 
Threat Assessment for 2024, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence noted that 
Al-Shabaab continued to advance its attack capabilities by acquiring weapons syste ms 
and had expanded its operations in northeast Kenya. (AN I) 
As of 2023, significant human rights concerns persisted, including credible reports 
of arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; 
torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government, etc. 
(AE I) 
Policies  
When evaluating an applicant ’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
   
 
 
 
  
   
 
     
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
 
  
  
 
   
 
    
 
 
 
 
   
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
8complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Accordin g 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole- person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive informat ion. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information). 
Analysis  
Guideline B: Foreign Influence  
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6 as follows: 
Foreign contacts and interests, including,  but  not limited to, business,  
financial,  and property interests,  are a national  security concern if they result  
in divided allegiance.  They  may also be a national security concern if they  
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or  induced  
to help a foreign person,  group, organization,  or government in a way  
inconsistent with U.S.  interests  or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure

or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and  
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest  
is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is  
known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or  
is associated with a risk of terrorism.  
Two disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case: 
AG ¶ 7(a):  contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family  memb
 er,  
business  or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen  
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates  a heightened risk  
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,  pressure, or  coercion;  
and  
AG ¶  7(b): con nections to a foreign person,  group, gov ernment, or  country  
that create a potential  conflict  of interest between the individual’s obligation  
to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the  
individual’s  desire to help a foreign person,  group, or  country by  providing  
that information or technology.  
The Unit
ed States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding 
sensitive information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to 
have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests 
inimical to those of the United States. To establish AG ¶ 7(a), the Government must 
demonstrate a “heightened risk” of exploitation due to Applicant’s contacts with Kenyan 
relatives and best friend. Given the presence and activities of al-Shabaab in Somalia and 
Kenya, as well as human rights issues, the Government has established the requisite 
“heightened risk” and potential conflict of interest regarding Applicant’s contacts with his 
Kenyan family members and his best friend. AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) apply. 
The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: 
AG ¶ 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country  
in w
hich these persons are located, or the positions or  activities  of those  
persons in that country  are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed  
in a position of having to choose between the interests of  a foreign  
individual, group,  organization,  or governm ent and the interests of the  
United States;  
AG ¶ 8(b):  there is no conflict of interest,  either  because the individual’s  
sense of loyalty  or obligation to the foreign person,  group,  government, or  
country is so minimal, or the individual has  such deep and longstanding  
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected 
to resolve any conflict  of interest in favor  of the U.S. interest;  and  
9 
 
 
 
  
    
      
  
 
    
   
   
   
      
 
    
  
 
   
 
 
        
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
AG ¶ 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and  
infr
equent  that there is little likelihood that it  could create a risk for  foreign  
influence or exploitation.   
Applic
ant’s sister, cousin, and best friend have no ties to the Kenyan government 
or military. His sister resides in the United States and maintains LPR status. He has 
limited contact with his cousin and best friend. AG ¶¶ 8(a) and 8(c) apply as to SOR ¶¶ 
1.c. and 1.d. 
Three of Applicant’s brothers currently serve in the Kenyan Army. His father is 
retired from the Kenyan Army and receives a military pension. Applicant maintains regular 
contact with his immediate family members in Kenya. His children resided in Kenya, living 
with Applicant’s parents and brother, until 2021. Applicant continues to provide monthly 
financial support to his parents. He has traveled several times to Kenya, and he traveled 
with his wife and children in June 2024 to visit his family there. There is nothing improper 
about such contacts with one’s foreign family mem bers; however, the nature and 
frequency of these contacts demonstrate the depth of Applicant’s relationship with his 
parents and brothers in Kenya. None of the foreign influence mitigating conditions apply 
to SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b. 
Guideline F:  Financial Considerations  
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts,  and meet financial  
obligations may  indicate poor  self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise  
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to  
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial  distress can  also be  
caused or exacerbated by,  and thus can be a possible indicator of, other  
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,  mental  
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An  
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to  
engage in illegal  or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  . . .  
 
T
he guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. The 
following are potentially applicable in this case: 
AG ¶ 19(a)  inability to satisfy debts;  
AG  ¶ 19(c) a history  of  not m eeting financial obligations; and  
AG ¶  19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state,  or loc al  
income tax returns or failure to pay  annual Federal, state,  or local income  
tax as required.

The Government established that the IRS had filed a Federal tax lien in November 
2023 in the approximate amount of $59,494. As of September 2024, Applicant owed 
delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest totaling approximately $74,396. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(f) apply. 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
under
 such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  probl em were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of  employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical emergency, a death,  divorce, or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;  
(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-fai th  effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
(g) the
 individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
Applicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An 
applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or 
required to be debt-free. “Rather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly 
given [her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied 
by ‘concomitant conduct,’ that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the 
plan.” ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
13-00987 at 3, n.5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). 
Applicant credibly testified that he relied upon a tax preparer who made incorrect 
calculations on his TY 2019 and TY 2020 returns. Although Applicant received some 
correspondence from the IRS in 2021, his return for TY 2021 was not re- examined until 
July 2023. I have also considered Applicant’s attempts to engage a TRF in 2022. He failed 
to provide documentary evidence of the engagement and scope of TRF1; however, he 
did provided proof of $9,300 in payments in early 2022. There is no evidence of any tax 
payments between March 2022 and January 2024, despite two IRS installment 
agreements. Between January and August 2024, he made 11 payments totaling 
11 
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
 
      
 
   
 
  
    
  
   
 
   
   
    
    
  
     
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
   
    
     
     
 
  
 
  
    
 
  
 
 
      
   
   
  
approximately $5,457. He scheduled two $500 payments in September 2024; however, 
there is no evidence to corroborate that the payments were completed. In October 2024, 
he initiated a new IRS installment agreement, and he claimed payments in November 
and December 2024. He provided documentary evidence of payments in January 2025 
($300), March 2025 ($300), and two payments in July 2025 (totaling $600). 
The record only contains documentary evidence of four of nine required payments 
since the October 2024 agreement began, including two timely payments and two 
payments after Applicant’s security clearance hearing. I have considered that Applicant 
testified that he and his wife were behind on some of their credit -card accounts. I have 
also considered that Applicant’s total delinquent tax balance has been reduced from 
$74,396 to $55,774, due to the waiver of the TY2019 penalties, Applicant’s payments, 
and the application of his refunds for recent tax years. Applicant’s documented payments 
since January 2024 total approximately $6,657. 
Applicant has not provided sufficient documentary evidence to show that he acted 
responsibly to address his tax delinquencies once brought to his attention by the IRS in 
2021. The timing of Applicant’s debt -resolution efforts is relevant and material to the 
evaluation of her evidence in mitigation. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 16- 03595 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Aug. 27, 2018)(timing of debt-resolution efforts is relevant in evaluating the sufficiency 
of case in mitigation). He provided some evidence of engaging TRFs on his behalf; 
however, it is not clear the scope and progress of each TRF. Most importantly, he has not 
demonstrated a track record of payments in compliance with an IRS installment 
agreement. His recent financial struggles, since his employment with the DOD contractor 
ended and his wife’s treatment, also remain a concern. He did not mitigate the financial 
considerations security concerns. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the a dministrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should 
consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; ( 5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially

disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline B, Guideline F, 
and the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. 
Applicant received awards, certificates, and a letter of support for his longtime 
employment with DOD contractors while stationed overseas. I found his testimony honest 
and sincere; however, the explanations about his work with the TRFs w ere muddled, 
uncorroborated, and unreliable. With a track record of payments in compliance with the 
IRS installment agreement, he may be able to mitigate the financial considerations 
security concerns. But as of now, he has not provided sufficient documentary evide nce 
to do so. Applicant’s contacts with and financial support of his immediate family members 
in Kenya are natural and appropriate, yet these contacts create a potential conflict of 
interest. At this time, he has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:  AGAINST APPLICANT  
Subparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.
 :  
Subparagraphs 1.c.-1.d. :  
Against Applicant  
For Applicant  
Paragraph 2, G uideline F:   AGAINST  APPLICANT  
Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against  Applicant  
Conclusion  
In li
ght of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude 
that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant ’s 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
