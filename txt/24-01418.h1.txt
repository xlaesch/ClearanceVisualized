Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On October 25, 2023, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On September 27, 2024, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A, the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility t o Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine

whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On October 3, 2024, 
Applicant provided his response to the SOR. On November 27, 2024, Department 
Counsel was ready to proceed. On December 11, 2024, the case was assigned to me. 
On December 30, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice 
scheduling the hearing on February 26, 2025. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled, 
using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant did not offer any documents into evidence. (Tr. 11, 15- 16; GE 1-GE 4) There 
were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 16) On 
March 7, 2025, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. The record was not held open 
after the hearing for post-hearing documentation. (Tr. 59) 
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. His 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
Applicant is 33 years old, and he has worked for a government contractor for the 
previous 15 months. (Tr. 6-8,18) In 2009, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) He has 
about three college credits.  (Tr. 6-7) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In 2012, he 
married, and he and his spouse have adopted two children who are ages 13 and 15. (Tr. 
7) 
Applicant was unemployed from June of 2022 until about November of 2022. (Tr.  
19) From June of  2021 to June of 2022, he worked as a life insurance salesman. (Tr. 19)  
From July of 2020 to June of 2021, he worked as a storeroom  attendant. (Tr. 19) From  
March  of 2020 to June of 2020, he worked as  a warehouse associate. (Tr. 19-20) He was  
unemployed between October of 2015 and March of 2017,  and his spouse worked outside  
their home dur ing this time. (Tr.  19, 31; GE  1 at 15) She is  currently attending c ollege t o  
become a teacher, and she has  not worked outside their home since 2023. (Tr. 38) He  
does not require a security clearance for his current position; however, the absence of a  
security clearance reduces his  ability to do some work-related functions. (Tr. 53)  
Financial Considerations   
Applicant fell behind on several debts because of home repair expenses, such as 
replacement of his roof, and five months of unemployment in 2022. (Tr. 19, 21) In August 
2017, he was diagnosed with a disease, and it was necessary for him to take time off 
from work because he was unable to work as hard as previously. (Tr. 27, 32) He was 
unable to obtain part -time employment because of his reduced stamina due to the 
disease. (Tr. 27)

Applicant’s September 27, 2024 SOR alleges, and his November 11, 2023, and 
July 9, 2024 credit bureau reports (CBRs) state, he has three delinquent debts totaling 
$36,122. The status of the SOR debts is as follows: 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges, and Applicant admitted, he has an account placed for collection 
for $17,444. (SOR response) In 2016, Applicant and his spouse borrowed funds to 
replace the roof of their home. (Tr. 22- 23, 30- 32) It was assigned to collections in 
December of 2021. (Tr. 25; GE 3 at 2) Applicant said he was unable to make payments 
because he had too many expenses. (Tr. 26) 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges, and Applicant admitted, he has a charged- off account for 
$16,767. (SOR response) Applicant and his spouse borrowed funds to replace the 
windows in their home. (Tr. 30 -31) He made about six payments, and then he stopped 
making payments because they were unable to afford the payments. (Tr. 33) In October 
of 2016, the creditor charged off the debt. (Tr. 29, 32; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2) 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges, and Applicant admitted, in February of 2023, his medical 
account was placed for collection for $1,911. (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 3; SOR response) He did 
not make any payments on the account. (Tr. 36-38) 
Applicant’s annual income after taxes is about $38,000. (Tr. 38) He tries to use a 
budget. (Tr. 42) He was unsure if he had a remainder at the end of the month after paying 
debts and expenses. (Tr. 43) He does not have a 401(k) account. (Tr. 44) He has abo ut 
$100 in his savings account. (Tr. 43) He did not attempt to negotiate payment plans for 
his three SOR creditors. (Tr. 48) He considered entering into a debt consolidation plan or 
refinancing his house to resolve his debts; however, he chose not to implement these 
ideas. (Tr. 28) 
Applicant received a $4,000 refund for tax year (TY) 2023 from the IRS and a 
$5,000 refund for TY 2024. (Tr. 50, 53) Applicant and his spouse used the refunds to 
purchase furniture, such as new beds for the children, and new cell phones, and to pay 
some expenses and some debts. (Tr. 50) They did not use the refunds to address their 
SOR debts. 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition  by substantial  
evidence,  the burden  shifts to the applicant to rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or  mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶  E3.1.15. An applicant “has  the ultimate burden of  demonstrating that it  
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant  or continue his [or  her] security  
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of  
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at  5 (App. Bd.  Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if  
they  must, on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overe xtended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” 
“[A] single debt can be sufficient to raise Guideline F security concerns.” ISCR 
Case No. 19- 02667 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 14- 05366 at 3 
(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2016)). “Additionally, a single debt that remains unpaid over a period of 
years can properly be characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Id. 
The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). 
Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. 
Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20, which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
  
 
  
   
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  
 so infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  pr oblem were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has  received or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- f aith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  and  
(e) the individual has  a r easonable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue.  
The 
Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
AG ¶ 20(a) does  not apply to the SOR debts. “It is also well established that  an  
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts  demonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can  
be viewed as recent for purposes of  the Guideline F  mitigating conditions.” ISCR 22-
02226 at  2 (App.  Bd.  Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No.  15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.  
16, 2017)).  
Applicant was unemployed, underemployed, and had a disease which limited the 
work that he could do. These factors are circumstances largely beyond his control, which 
adversely affected his finances. However, “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] financial difficulti es 
6 
 
 
 
 
    
 
  
   
 
      
   
   
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
   
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
initially arose, in whole or in part,  due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the  
[administrative judge]  could still consider whether [the applicant] has since acted in a  
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-
11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12,  2007). The DOHA Appeal Board has said:  
[A]
n applicant  must  act  responsibly  given his  or  her  circumstances  and develop 
a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct even if  
it may only provide for  the payment of debts one at a time.  ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What constitutes responsible behavior  
depends on the facts of a given case and the fact that an applicant's debts will  
not be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.  
ISCR C ase No.  09-08462 at  4.  Relevant  to the equation is  an assessment  as  to 
whether an applicant acted responsibly given her limited resources  See, e.g.,  
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct  29, 2009).  
ADP Case No. 23-00547 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2024). 
Applicant’s September 27, 2024 SOR alleges, and Applicant admitted, he is 
responsible for three delinquent debts totaling $36,122. He did not establish that he acted 
reasonably under the circumstances. He could have used his federal income tax refunds 
to start a payment plan with at least one of his three SOR creditors. He has not made any 
progress addressing his delinquent SOR debts, and the connections to and financial costs 
of his unemployment, underemployment, and medical issues are insufficient under t he 
circumstances to fully establish AG ¶ 20(b). 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. “[U]ntil an applicant has a meaningful 
financial track record, it cannot be said as a matter of law that he has initiated a good-
faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts. The phrase 
‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through 
payment on debts.” ISCR 22-02226 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 
05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007)). There is no evidence that Applicant is working to 
establish payment plans to address his SOR debts. I am not confident that he will 
establish payment plans, pay, or otherwise resolve any of the three unresolved SOR 
debts, and maintain his financial responsibility. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
7 
 
 
      
  
   
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
   
 
  
     
     
  
  
   
   
 
 
  
    
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
    
   
  
    
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is 33 years old, and he has worked for a government contractor for the 
previous 15 months. His finances were adversely affected by underemployment, 
unemployment, and disease. His spouse has been attending college for the previous two 
years, and she has not been employed outside their home. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations analysis section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the 
evidence of mitigation. Applicant’s September 27, 2024 SOR alleges, and Applicant 
admitted, he has three delinquent debts totaling $36,122. He did not establish that he was 
unable to make more timely and significant progress resolving his SOR debts. The 
financial evidence raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards resolution of his debts and maintenance of his financi al 
responsibility, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to 
grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to classified 
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
