Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On May 5, 2022, and July 11, 2018, Applicant completed Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing or security clearance applications (SCAs). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1; GE 2 ) On November 5, 2024, the Defense 
Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) 
to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) 
(January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing 
in Appendix A, the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA did not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and said his case will be submitted to an Administrative Judge for 
 
 
   
   
  
  
  
  
     
 
 
 
   
     
 
 
     
   
 
    
    
  
 
 
     
     
   
      
   
 
  
 
   
   
 
      
    
     
   
 
a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or revoke his security clearance. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On 
April 23, 2025, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a hearing. On June 
18, 2025, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July 3, 2025, the case was 
assigned to me. On July 15 , 202 5, DOHA issued a notice setting the hearing for 
September 4, 2025. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled, using the Microsoft 
Teams video teleconference system. (HE 1) 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11  exhibits;  Applicant offered 11 
exhibits;  and all  proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection.  (Tr.  12-
14; GE 1 -GE  11;  Applicant  Exhibit (AE) A -AE K)1  On September 18, 2025,  DOHA  
received a copy of the transcript.  After the hearing Applicant provided seven exhibits, and  
they were admitted without objection. (AE L -AE R) On November 17,  2025, the last  
exhibits  were  received, and the record closed  that same day.    
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. Unless stated otherwise, the 
source for the information in the findings of fact is Applicant response to the SOR. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. 
Applicant is a 53-year-old senior system administrator. (Tr. 15, 17) He has never 
married. (Tr. 15-16) He has an associate degree in computer electronics and networking. 
(Tr. 16) He has not served in the military. (GE 1; GE 2) 
Financial Considerations  
Applicant’s salary varied from $75,000 to $115,000 over the last seven years 
because he has held several different employments. (Tr. 31-32; AE N) His current annual 
salary is about $100,000. (Tr. 17, 31) His monthly expenses are approximately as follows: 
rent $1,400; car loan $650; cell phone $90; utilities $50; and Internet $100. (Tr. 1 7) His 
monthly remainder is about $3,500. (Tr. 17, 33) 
In 2018 and 2019, Applicant had about $25,000 in delinquent debt. (Tr. 57-58) He 
conceded that some of his financial problems were caused by “procrastination.” (Tr. 58) 
His accounts were current in 2022. (Tr. 58) 
In 2022, Applicant’s parents and sister came to visit him , and the recreational 
vehicle they were living in had mechanical problems. (Tr. 25-26) Applicant moved out of 
his apartment because he and his relatives needed a larger place to stay, and expenses 
of about $15,000 resulted from the ir lengthy visit. (Tr. 25 -26, 50 -52) Some accounts 
1  Pages 190 to 234 were incorrectly included in the record, and those pages are not  admitt ed into evidence.

became delinquent. (Tr. 25-26) In the last several years, he used several debt resolution 
companies to help him arrange settlement agreements or payment plans. (Tr. 57) 
The SOR alleges about $52,000 in delinquent federal income taxes (FITs) for tax 
years (TYs) 2014 through 2017, and about $23,000 in non-tax related debt. The status of 
debts is as follows. 
FIT  issues  
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d allege Applicant is indebted to the federal government as 
follows: TY 2017 for $14,434; TY 2016 for $14,480; TY 2015 for $13,659; and TY 2014 
for $9,851, respectively. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant has a FIT lien filed against him in 
2018 for $45,771. In his April 23, 2025 SOR response, Applicant said he hired a tax 
negotiation entity (TNE) to “help resolve his tax delinquencies and negotiations are 
ongoing.” (HE 3) He is paying TNE about $50 monthly to resolve his tax issues. 
(Tr. 18-19) He signed an initial agreement with TNE in December 2022, and re-engaged 
TNE on November 5, 2024. (Tr. 20, 35) He re-engaged TNE again on April 3, 2025, just 
before he submitted his SOR response. (Tr. 35) He said he made about seven monthly 
payments of $814 starting in April 2025 to TNE. (Tr. 36-37) 
Applicant said he timely filed his TYs 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023 FIT returns; 
however, the IRS lost his TYs 2019 and 2021 FIT returns. (Tr. 39-41) I credited him with 
timely filing his TYs 2019 and 2021 federal and state income tax returns . (HE 4) At the 
end of August 2025, TNE filed Applicant’s FIT return for TY 2024. (Tr. 37-38) He intends 
to pay all of his delinquent taxes in the next five years. (Tr. 19) In 2024, TNE filed his FIT 
returns for TYs 2019 and 2021 because the IRS did not have a record of receipt of those 
tax returns. (Tr. 41-42)  
Applicant explained how he became delinquent on his taxes: 
About 2014, all the way up to 2018 -- I hate to say I’m a serial procrastinator. 
That’s one of my issues. That’s part of my bipolar condition. But I got ahead 
and filed back in 2019. We had a payment agreement with them, got them 
all satisfied. And I know from 2020, we had that pandemic, and they stopped 
collecting in March for some reason. I don’t know why. You could not get a 
hold of anybody at the IRS to deal with it for about a year or two there. So I 
ended up had to go through [TNE] to get my tax filings going because they 
did not file my 2019 or [2021] taxes; they had no record of them. Like, well, 
they were filed, but the IRS didn’t have a record of it. So I had to go through 
them, get everything straightened out, get a tax thing going or a tax payment 
plan. (Tr. 19-20) 
In  November  2019, Applicant started a payment plan with the IRS.  (Tr. 43-44) In  
2020, the IRS stopped the payment plan  because of  the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. 43 -
44) When he filed his  TY 2024 FIT  return,  he owed $15,000,  which he has not  paid.  (Tr.  
63)  Applicant  said his current  delinquent  FIT debt  for TYs  2014 through 2024  is about  
$130,000.  (Tr.  42)  At the time of  his hearing,  he did  not  have an  installment agreement

with the IRS. (Tr. 45) TNE sent a proposed payment plan to the IRS in which TNE said 
Applicant would pay $2,500 monthly to the IRS. (Tr. 64) He believes he can make 
payments on his other debts and pay $2,500 monthly to the IRS. (Tr. 64) He said he filed 
all of his state income tax returns. (Tr. 70) On September 25, 2025, which was after his 
hearing, he wrote two checks to the IRS for $2,815 each . (AE P at 20) In the comments 
on the two checks it indicates the payments are for April and June 2025. (AE P at 20) 
The IRS  tax transcripts  for  TYs 2008 to 20 13 and 20 18  to 2020  were no t provided.  
Applicant provided the IRS wage and income transcripts for TYs 2015 through 2024. (AE 
N)  The IRS tax transcript s  for TYs  2022 and 2023 indicate an IRS installment payment  
plan was approved on September 24, 2025; however, the first payment  was  not received.  
(AE R at 1 , 7)  An email from  his representative and an IRS installment plan, dated  
October, 3, 2025, state the IRS has agreed to an installment plan with the first monthly  
payment of  $851  due by  November 16, 2025.  (AE N;  AE  S  at 14)  This IRS installment   
plan is  to resolve FIT  debts  for TYs 2012, and 2015 through 2023. (AE N) It does  not  
indicate the total amount of the FIT  debt for those TYs.   
The following table depicts FIT information from Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts and 
the IRS tax lien from 2018. (GE 3; GE 4) Adjusted gross income is rounded to the nearest

Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts, which are dated April 2, 2024, for TYs 2014 through 
2017, show no payments were made to the IRS after his tax returns were filed. (GE 3) 
They also show establishment of installment agreements in 2018 and 2019. (GE 3) IRS 
enforcement was blocked during the COVID-19 pandemic. (GE 3) Applicant did not 
provide any corroborating evidence that he made payments under the IRS installment 
agreements in 2018 and 2019.

Falsification of 2022 SCA.   
Applicant’s July 11, 2018 SCA, asked in Section 26, Financial Record, Taxes, in 
the last seven years, have you failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes when 
required by law or ordinance? (GE 1) Applicant answered, “Yes ,” and he disclosed that 
he failed to file FIT returns and pay FITs in full for TYs 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. (Tr. 
49-51; GE 2) He estimated that he owed FIT s of $4,500 for TY 2012, $0 for TY 2014, 
$6,500 for TY 2015, and $0 for TY 2016. Id. He said he forgot to file or procrastinated or 
both. Id. 
Applicant’s May 5, 2022 SCA, asked in Section 26, Financial Record, Taxes, in the 
last seven years, have you failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes when required 
by law or ordinance? (GE 1) Applicant answered, “No.” In his 2022 SCA , he disclosed 
nine delinquent debts , and he said the debts were caused by “job change, relocation 
costs and pandemic.” (GE 1) He said all of the delinquent debts would be resolved not 
later than the winter of 2023. (GE 1) 
At his hearing, Applicant said he did not understand the question about taxes in 
his 2022 SCA. (Tr. 60) He also said he believed his tax returns were filed, and he had an 
IRS payment plan. (Tr. 61) 
Department Counsel reminded Applicant that he stopped making payments to the  
IRS during the COVID -19 pandemic, and he engaged TNE in December 2022. (Tr. 61-
62) Department Counsel asked, “So you just  lied on the security clearance form; is that  
accurate?” and Applicant answered, “I guess.” (Tr. 62)  
After his hearing, he said: 
It was never my intention to omit, defraud, or conceal any information 
regarding my tax delinquencies from the Government. Although I cannot 
attest to my mindset at the time I completed the SF -86, I have been 
diagnosed with bi -polar mood disorder and a learning disability. These 
diagnoses often lead to misreading, misunderstanding, or overlooking 
certain questions on forms. I believe that my self -reporting of my financial 
debts in the May 5, 2025, SF-86 shows that it was not my intent to withhold 
pertinent information. I acknowledge and understand the importance of 
being open and honest with all national security investigations and believe 
I have since provided all information regarding my financial delinquencies. 
(AE T at 18) 
In his May 5, 2022 SCA, Applicant said he stopped treatment for his bipolar mood 
disorder “in 2016 due to job change and address change.” (GE 1 at 44- 45) His bipolar 
mood disorder will not be considered for disqualification purposes because there is 
insufficient evidence of how it might raise security concerns.

Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he submitted false information in his May 5, 
2022 SCA, and this information will not be considered for disqualification purposes. It will 
be considered for the limited purposes detailed in the analysis, infra. 
Non-tax SOR debts  
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt owed to an appliance company 
for about $5,538. He said from 2022 to 2023, he had a $100 monthly payment plan with 
the creditor. (Tr. 47) On August 5, 2025, he obtained a new payment plan , which is 
acceptable to the creditor, and the settlement balance is $3,894. He will be able to settle 
the debt by making 12 monthly $194 payments totaling about $2,300 , with the first 
payment due on August 8, 2025. (Tr. 21, 47; AE D, at 15) 
SOR ¶ 1. g alleges Applicant has a charged- off debt for about $4,176. He has a 
payment plan, which is acceptable to the creditor. He is supposed to make $348 monthly 
payments for 12 months. (Tr. 21-22; AE E at 17) After his hearing, he provided a receipt 
showing the debt was paid. (AE Q at 22) 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for about $4,304. On July 23, 
2025, he received a settlement offer for $1,458. (Tr. 48) He has a $100 monthly payment 
plan, which is acceptable to the creditor, and the balance is $1,448. (Tr. 22, 48-49; AE F 
at 19-21) He made the first $100 payment to the creditor. (Tr. 49) 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant has a debt that is past due for $594 with a total loan 
balance of about $8,995. He has a $ 250 monthly payment plan, which is acceptable to 
the creditor, and the balance is $7,700. (Tr. 23) He said it should be paid in three years. 
(Tr. 23) 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges Applicant has a debt placed for collection for about $6,492. He 
received the funds from the creditor in 2022. (Tr. 54) On July 23, 2025, the creditor offered 
him a settlement for $3,245. (Tr. 53; AE G at 24 ) He has a $143 monthly payment plan, 
which is acceptable to the creditor, and he made the first payment. (Tr. 23, 53-54; AE G 
at 23) The debt should be paid in 2026. (Tr. 23) 
SOR  ¶ 1.k  alleges Applicant has an insurance d ebt  placed for collection for about  
$350.  SOR ¶ 1.l alleges Applicant has a charged- off debt for about $522.  SOR ¶ 1.n  
alleges Applicant has  a debt placed for collection for about $229.  In his April 23, 2025  
SOR response,  he said th ese t hree  debts  are  paid, and he provided corroborating  
documentation. (Tr. 23-25; AE H at 27-28; AE  K  at 5;  AE I  at 28-29)  The debt in SOR  ¶  
1.l was paid on February 23, 2024. (AE K)  
SOR ¶ 1. m  alleges Applicant has a charged- off debt  for about $ 806, and  SOR        
¶ 1.o alleges Applicant  has a debt placed for  collection for about $59.  In his  April 23, 2025  
SOR response,  he said these  two  debts  do not belong to  him  and  are  being disputed.  (HE  
3)  They were removed  from  his most recent credit report. (Tr.  24-25)

Applicant received credit counseling. (Tr. 27; AE C at 23) He uses a budget and a 
debt repayment plan. (Tr. 28; AE J at 2 of 22) His credit reports indicate he has several 
debts in paid, current, or paid as agreed status. 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of  the Executive  
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing,  
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”  Department  of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.  
518,  528 (1988). As  Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control  
access  to information bearing on national security and to determine  whether an individual  
is sufficiently  trustworthy to have access to such information.”  Id.  at 527. The  President  
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for  
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the  
national  interest to do so.”  Exec.  Or. 10865,  Safeguarding Classified Information within  
Industry  § 2 ( Feb. 20, 1960),  as amended.   
.  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria

listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition  by substantial  
evidence,  the burden  shifts to the applicant to rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or  mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶  E3.1.15. An applicant “has  the ultimate burden of  demonstrating that it  
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant  or continue his [or  her] security  
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of  
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at  5 (App. Bd.  Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if  
they  must, on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).   
Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
AG ¶ 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: 
(a)  i
nability to satisfy  debts;  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
     
    
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
(b) unwillingness  to s atisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
(c) a history of not  mee ting financial  obligations; and  
(f)  failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax
 returns  or failure to pay annual Federal, state,  or local income tax as  
required.   
The rec
ord establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶ ¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), 
and 19 (f), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying condition is contained in the mitigation section, 
infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  s o infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  probl em were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practi ces, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has r eceived or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- fai th effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;     
(e) the individual has  a reas onable basis to  dispute the legitimacy  of the 
past-due debt which is  the cause of the problem and provides documented  
proof to substantiate the basis of  the dispute or provides evidence of  actions  
to resolve the issue; and  
(g) the individual has  mad e arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
The A
ppeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows:

Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
Applicant had some circumstances partially or fully beyond his control, which 
adversely affected his finances. In 2022, Applicant’s parents and sister came to visit him 
and their recreational vehicle had mechanical problems. Applicant moved out of his 
apartment because they needed a place to stay, and expenses of about $15,000 resulted 
from their visit. In his May 5, 2022 SCA, he disclosed nine delinquent debts, and he said 
the debts were caused by “job change, relocation costs and pandemic.” (GE 1) 
However, “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or 
in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could 
still consider whether [the applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 
12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 
99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99- 0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 
1999)). Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He 
should have acted sooner to establish payment plans. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. 
Non-tax debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.n allege 14 delinquent debts totaling about 
$23,000. Applicant paid the four debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n. He 
disputed the two debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.o because he did not recognize the accounts, 
and they were removed from his credit report. He received settlement amounts from 
several creditors, which reduced the magnitude of those debts, and he made the initial 
payments under the creditor’s payment plans.  
In ADP Case No. 23-00547 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2024), the DOHA Appeal Board 
said: 
[A]n applicant  must act responsibly given his or her circumstances and  
develop a reasonable plan for repayment,  accompanied by concomitant  
conduct even if it may  only provide for the payment of  debts one at  a time.  
ISCR Case No. 07 -06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21 , 2008). What  constitutes  
responsible behavior  depends on the facts  of  a given case and the fact that  
an applicant’s debts will not  be paid off  for a long time, in and of itself, may  
be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. 09- 08462 at 4. Relevant  to  
the equation is an assessment  as to whether  an applicant acted responsibly  
given [his  or]  her limited resources  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at  3-
4 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009).

“[U]ntil an applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as a 
matter of law that he has initiated a good- faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolved debts. The phrase ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes 
evidence of actual debt reduction through payment on debts.” ISCR Case No. 22-02226 
at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 05- 01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 
2007)). 
A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is designed 
to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 
09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicants are not required “to be debt-free in order 
to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act 
responsibly given his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by ‘concomitant conduct’ that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to 
effectuate the plan.” ISCR Case No. 15- 02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (denial of 
security clearance remanded) (citing ISCR Case No.13- 00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 
14, 2014)). There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be 
paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
Applicant has an established history of paying his non-tax debts. He has taken 
meaningful actions to address several of the delinquent SOR debts. His credit report s 
indicate he has several debts in paid, current, or paid as agreed status, and he has an 
established track record of paying most of his non-tax debts. His history of making 
payments increases the confidence that he will maintain his financial responsibility with 
respect to his non-tax debts.  
Applicant has demonstrated a good- faith effort to resolve his non-tax debts. His 
non-tax delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to 
recur and [do] not cast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good 
judgment.” There are clear indications that his financial problems related to his non- tax 
debts are resolved or being resolved and under control. His finances with respect to SOR 
¶¶ 1.f through 1.o do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustwort hiness, and 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(d), and 20(e) are established for his non-tax debts. Financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated for his non-tax debts. 
FIT issues. SOR ¶¶ 1. a through 1.d allege Applicant is indebted to the federal 
government as follows: TY 2017 for $14,434; TY 2016 for $14,480; TY 2015 for $13,659; 
and TY 2014 for $9,851. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant has a FIT lien filed against him in 
2018 for $45,771. These five SOR allegations are establish ed, and there is substantial 
evidence of the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) with 
respect to these five SOR allegations. 
Applicant has owed delinquent taxes since 2009 (for TY 2008). He failed to timely 
file his FIT returns for TYs 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2022, and 2023. He failed 
to disclose his failure to timely file and pay his FITs on his May 5, 2022 SCA. He falsely 
claimed at his hearing that he did not understand the tax question on his 2022 SCA even 
though he correctly answered it on his 2018 SCA. He answered other questions about

finances on his 2022 SCA, which indicate he read the SCA . These issues w ere not 
alleged in the SOR. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal 
Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered stating: 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s  
evidence of  extenuation,  mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to  
consider whether an applicant has  demonstrated successful rehabilitation;   
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is  
applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under  
Directive Section 6.3.  
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02 -07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-
0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12- 09719 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Apr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR 
Case No. 03- 20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These non-SOR allegations (more 
delinquent FITs than alleged, some FIT returns not timely filed, false statement in 2022 
SCA about FITs, and false explanation at his hearing about not understanding tax 
questions on his SCA) will be considered in the credibility assessment, for their impact on 
mitigation, and under the whole- person concept. They will not be considered for 
disqualification purposes. 
Failure to timely file FIT returns. This is a non-SOR allegation. Applicant did not 
provide sufficient justification for not timely filing tax returns for TYs 2008, 2009, 2010, 
2014, 2015, 2016, 2022, and 2023. 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a FIT return 
is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. § 7203, willful failure to 
file return or supply information, reads: 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority 
thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who 
willfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such 
information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor. . . . 
A willful failure to make return, keep records,  or supply information when required,  
is a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of  any tax liability.  Spies v. United  
States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943);  United States v.  Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9
th  Cir. 1973);  United  
States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969);  O’Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  
Cir. 1931).  For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely  
file his  FIT  returns against him  as a crime.  Regarding  the failure to timely file his  FIT  
returns, the Appeal Board has commented:  
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has  a problem with  
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary  
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified

information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14 -01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
ISCR Case No.  14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.  15, 2016) (emphasis in original).  See  ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at  4 (App. Bd. June 15,  2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-
05476 at 5 (App.  Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No.  01-05340 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec.  
20,  2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App.  Bd. Aug. 18,  2015).   
The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) explained 
that in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, 
grant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. 
Bd. June 15, 2016), the applicant filed his 2011 FIT return in December 2013, his 2012 
FIT return in September 2014, and his 2013 FIT return in October 2015. He received FIT 
refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. Nevertheless, the Appeal Board revers ed the 
administrative judge’s decision to grant access to classified information. 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file FIT returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15- 01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well that ends well” 
analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).  
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG ¶ 20(g) applied, and noted: 
The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in 
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who 
begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that 
his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self -discipline to 
follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat 
to his own interests. 
In this instance, Applicant has owed FITs since 2009. He said his current 
delinquent tax debt for TYs 2014 through 2024 is about $130,000. At the time of his 
13 
 
 
  
 
 
     
 
   
    
     
  
   
    
 
     
 
      
    
  
 
    
  
  
 
   
     
     
         
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
      
  
   
 
hearing, he did not have an installment agreement with the IRS. After his hearing, he 
provided two checks dated September 25, 2025, in which the IRS was payee for $2,815 
each. In the comments on the two checks it indicated the payments are for April and June 
2025. 
Applicant under withheld payments to the IRS from his income as recently as TY 
2024. His FIT debt for TY 2024 is $11,300. As of October 3, 2025, Applicant has an 
Installment Agreement with the IRS, and his first payment was due in November 2025. 
His approved IRS installment payment plan, and his two checks written to the IRS after 
his hearing are sufficient to establish AG ¶ 20(g); however, his overall handling of his 
taxes from 2009 to present leave lingering security concerns. 
In ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007), the Appeal Board said: 
The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person 
factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to 
the particular facts of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. 
Bd. Jan.15, 2003). Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does 
not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance 
decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole 
and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable 
evidence, or vice versa. 
Applicant did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress sooner in the 
payment of his delinquent taxes, withholding proper amounts from his income, and 
establishing installment payment plans. Under all the circumstances, and considering the 
evidence “as a whole,” Applicant’s failures regarding his FIT debts are not mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
14 
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
 
  
  
    
    
    
     
  
   
 
  
 
  
      
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
    
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is a 53-year-old senior system administrator . He has an associate 
degree in computer electronics and networking. 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the evidence of 
mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to establish payment plans and 
make payments under those plans sooner to address his FIT debt. His failure to take 
timely, prudent, responsible, good-faith actions from 2009 (when his TY 2008 taxes were 
due) to September of 2025 (when he wrote two checks to the IRS) raises unmitigated 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. 
See AG ¶ 18. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. 
See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. “[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record 
discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.” ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case 
No.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards resolution of his tax issues, he may well be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. 
Formal Findings

Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of 
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
