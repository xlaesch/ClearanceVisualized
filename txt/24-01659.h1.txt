Decision 
MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns 
arising from her delinquent debts. Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information 
is granted. 
Statement of the Case  
On April 12, 2024, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in 
connection with her employment in the defense industry. On February 21, 2025, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). DOD issued the SOR under 
Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became effective within the DOD 
on June 8, 2017.

Applicant answered the SOR on March 8, 2025, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The 
case was assigned to me on July 2, 2025. On July 3, 2025, following consultation by email 
with the parties, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for July 23, 2025, to occur 
by video teleconference. 
The hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and submitted documents that I marked as 
Applicant Exhibit s (AE) A through F. All exhibits were admitted without objection. 
Applicant also submitted numerous documents with her SOR response. These 
documents are not separately described or identified, except as needed, though they are 
in the record as part of Applicant’s answer. (Tr. 20) 
I left the hearing record open until August 6, 2025, to allow Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted a personal financial 
statement (PFS) (AE G) and four reference letters (combined as AE H). These exhibits 
are marked and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 
1, 2025. The record closed on August 6, 2025. 
Findings of Fact  
In her SOR response, Applicant addressed each debt but denied the specific 
amounts owed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g and provided supporting explanations and documents. 
I construe her answers as admitting each SOR debt but not the amounts alleged. (Tr. 9) 
Applicant is  50  years old.  She was  married for 24 years,  until 2020,  when she and  
her husband divorced.  They had separated in 2017.  She has a  28-year-old son and an  
18-year-old daughter.  She earned a bac helor’s degree in business  finance in 2015  and 
she has two associate degrees from a technical school (2012 and 2024)  (GE 1; Tr. 47 -
50, 68-69)   
Applicant worked at a bank for several years until late 2016, when she was laid off 
when the bank was sold. She was unemployed until mid -2017. From mid-2017 until 
September 2022, she held several positions in the banking and finance industries, mostly 
for the same employer. She began working for a federal contractor in October 2022 and 
has remained in the financial field. She began working with her most recent clearance 
sponsor in January 2023 and submitted her SCA in April 2024. She has never held a 
clearance before. (GE 1; Tr. 52-60) 
Applicant has been unemployed since March 21, 2025, shortly after the SOR was 
issued, though she remains sponsored for an industrial clearance as a federal contactor 
through another government agency (AGA) (GE 1; Tr. 35-) (This was not addressed at

hearing, but the AGA sponsoring Applicant’s federally contracted employment is covered 
by the Directive. (See Directive at ¶ 2.2)) 
Applicant disclosed several delinquent debts on her April 2024 SCA and disclosed 
that she has been working with a debt consolidation company. (GE 1) She discussed the 
full extent of her delinquencies in her background interview a month later, with assistance 
from the April 2024 credit report the interviewing agent provided. (GE 2, GE 3) This is the 
only credit report in the record. 
Applicant has worked in the financial field for many years. Because of her 
professional background, she takes her credit very seriously. She became financially 
overextended when her job was restructured and she lost the ability to earn commissions 
and overtime pay. She also acknowledged that she underestimated the costs of owning 
a home. Applicant purchased her home in March 2021, about a year after her divorce. 
She said her debts just built up over time. (Tr. 49- 52) She considered bankruptcy but 
wanted “to do the honorable thing and fight for my credit.” (Tr. 30-35, 47, 60-61) 
Instead of bankruptcy, Applicant contacted a debt relief firm. She contracted with 
a debt relief program (DRP) in August 2022, almost two years before submitting her SCA. 
She has been paying them $587 every two weeks ($1,174 a month) ever since. Many of 
the debts she listed in the DRP have already been resolved. (Tr. 31-47) 
AE F is a list of the 16 debts reported to the DRP. All of them are consumer 
accounts. The debts in the DRP total $66,037. According to the terms of the agreement, 
she expected (or expects) that the DRP would settle her debts at about 59% of what was 
owed ($38,961), while recouping fees of about $19,150. Applicant would pay $1,223 per 
month for 48 months until August 2026 -- a combined payment of $58,734 , resulting in 
expected savings to her of about $7,300. (AE F; Tr. 39-47) 
The seven debts in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a- 1.g) total $49,156. The debt totals are taken 
from the April 2024 credit report. (GE 2) All of the SOR debts are listed in the DRP, as of 
August 2022. (AE F) They are all consumer credit debts. (Tr. 63-64) 
The current status of the SOR debts is as follows: 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($ 10,387) is an account that has been charged off by Bank U. As of 
August 2022, Applicant owed $9,245 to this creditor. (AE F at debt 15). The account has 
not yet been addressed by the DRP but is part of the program. (Tr. 28-29) 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($ 9,538) is an account that has been charged off by Bank C. As of 
August 2022, Applicant owed $13,097 to this creditor. (AE F at debt 7). Applicant provided

documentation about the current status of this debt with her SOR response. ( Answer 
documents; Tr. 28) This account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($8,527) is a credit account with a home furnishing store , an account 
that has been charged off. As of August 2022, Applicant owed $4,647 to this creditor (AE 
F at debt 13) She documented that the DRP had arranged to settle the account (balance 
of $8,486) for $6,400 (10 monthly payments of $640). She documented that the first two 
payments have been made. (AE C; Tr. 23-24) This account is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.d ($6,555) is a credit account that has been charged off by Bank D. As of 
August 2022, Applicant owed $6,275 to this creditor (AE F at debt 9) Since July 2024, 
Applicant has made 12 of the 24 required payments to settle this account for $5,264. (AE 
E; Tr. 25-27) This account is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e ($6,329) is a credit account that has been charged off by Bank A. As of 
August 2022, Applicant owed $6,089 to this creditor. (AE F at debt 1) She provided 
documentation that in March 2025, the creditor agreed to settle the account (balance of 
$6,409) for $5,650, with an initial payment of $245 and monthly payments of $235 
thereafter, a 24-month payment schedule. (AE A) Applicant documented that she had 
made four payments, totaling $950. (AE B; Tr. 20-23) This account is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($5,095) is a credit account for a furniture store. As of August 2022, 
Applicant owed $4,801 to this creditor (AE F at debt 14) She provided documentation that 
the creditor recently agreed to settle the account for about $2,293 over 24 months. She 
documented that she had made two payments, totaling $ 191. (AE D; Tr. 24- 25) This 
account is being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($2,725) is a credit account that has been charged off by Bank W. As 
of August 2022, Applicant owed $2,162 to this creditor (AE F at debt 16) The account has 
not yet been addressed by the DRP but is part of the program. 
Applicant has also fallen further behind more recently, since the issuance of the 
SOR led to the removal of her interim clearance access (and thus, to the loss of her job). 
She wants to return to work so she can restabilize her finances and continue addressing 
her debts. (Tr. 74-76) 
Despite her recent employment issues, Applicant remains current on her 
mortgage, of about $1,500 a month. She is supported by her son. Her daughter is also 
self-sufficient. Applicant credited her finance degree with teaching her the impo rtance of 
good credit. (Tr. 64; AE G) She said she has good credit beyond the SOR debts. She has 
no student loans. (Tr. 67, 69)

Applicant has no unfiled tax returns but acknowledged three years of past -due 
federal income tax debt (2022, 2023, 2024). She estimated that she owes between 
$4,000 and $5,000 in-past-due taxes, for which she pays $100 a month in a repayment 
plan. She had state tax debt , l but it has already been paid  off. She attributed her tax 
debt to the fact that she no longer can claim her daughter as a dependent , though she 
acknowledged she may also be under-withholding. (Tr. 70-73) 
When Applicant submitted her post-hearing PFS, she included the income she was 
earning in March 2025, before she was laid off. At that time, she earned about $4,000 a 
month in net income, with a gross monthly salary of $5,079, an annual salary of almost 
$61,000. (Tr. 79; AE G) 
According to her PFS, Applicant has about $1,565 in monthly regular expenses 
(not including her mortgage). Her mortgage payment is about $1,522. Her payment to the 
DRP is about $1,175, and she has other credit card payments of about $680. Her debt 
payments total about $3,375. When combined with her $1,565 in regular expenses, she 
is running a deficit of about $930 each month, even when she was employed. She 
reported about $8,500 in savings. (AE G) 
Applicant submitted several character reference letters from people she knows 
well, either personally or professionally. All of them attested to her fine character, 
including her professionalism, integrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, honesty and 
respect for confidentiality. (AE H) 
Policies  
It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the 
Supreme Court has held, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). 
The adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the  
complexities  of  human  behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction  
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s  overarching  
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial,  and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a),  
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as  the “whole-
person concept.” The administrative judge must consider  all available, reliable information  
about  the person,  past and present, favorable and unfavorable,  in m aking a decision.  The  
protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG ¶ 2(b) requires that  
“[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information  
will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have drawn 
only those conclusions  that are reasonable, logical,  and based on the evidence contained

in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation 
or conjecture. 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.” 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off -duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Analysis  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
The security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, 
in relevant part, in AG ¶ 18: 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
Applicant became financially overextended after her 2020 divorce and 2021 home 
purchase. Her delinquent debts, as detailed and alleged in the SOR, total about $47,000. 
They are sufficient to raise financial considerations security concerns under AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
(inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).

The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  
und
er such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  pr oblem were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory  lending practices, or identity theft), and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has  received or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;  and  
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- f aith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts  
Appl
icant has had a long career in the financial industry. When she found herself 
in dire financial straits, she decided to address her debts through a debt consolidation 
firm rather than bankruptcy. She contracted with a DRP in August 2022 and entered 16 
consumer debts into the program. She has been paying almost $1,200 a month to them 
ever since. Her original debt load, as of August 2022, was about $66,000. Several of 
those debts are now resolved, or at least they are not reflected in the SOR, which alleges 
seven debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g). 
Of those, all but two (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g) are under settlement and repayment 
arrangements through the DRP, and Applicant expects that the others will follow and that 
she will continue to address her debts as best she can. She has been unemployed since 
losing her interim clearance in March 2025 but she has kept up her payments. 
Applicant’s financial problems are not entirely due to circumstances beyond her 
control. She purchased a home after her divorce but acknowledges that she simply 
became overextended financially. She has some recent past-due taxes, all attributable to 
under-withholdings. This lessens the mitigating effect here, as it cannot be said that her 
debts are largely attributable to circumstances beyond her control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not 
fully apply. AG ¶ 20(a) does not fully apply since Applicant’s debts are ongoing.

However, the Appeal Board has held that it is not necessary to pay off all the debts 
alleged in the SOR, nor is it required that they be paid off in any particular way. What is 
required is only that an a pplicant have a reasonable plan to pay off her debts and have 
taken some steps towards execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 
3 (App. Bd. May 3, 2011; ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014). Rather, 
an applicant is required to demonstrate that he or she has “established a plan to resolve 
his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
Applicant has established that several of her SOR debts are being responsibly paid 
and resolved. She has repayment agreements in place for several of her debts . While 
several of them remain unresolved, I conclude that her debts are sufficiently under control 
and under a responsible, long-term repayment plan. I conclude that Applicant has shown 
enough good faith to repay her creditors and to resolve her overdue debts, backed by 
corroborating documentation. AG ¶ 20(d) apples. 
Whole Person Concept  
I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered that the favorable evidence 
substantially outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also gave due consideration to the 
whole-person concept, her credible testimony, and to her character evidence, under the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude she provided 
sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. 
Formal  Findings  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:  For Applicant 
Conclusion  
Considering all the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified 
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
