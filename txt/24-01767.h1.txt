Decision  
HALE, Charles C., Administrative Judge: 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on January 24, 2024. The 
Department of Defense (DoD) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 26, 
2024, alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). 
Applicant answered the SOR on December 31, 202 4, the Government amended 
the SOR on February 26, 2025, and Applicant answered the amended SOR on March 28, 
2025. Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed on February 28, 2025, and the case was assigned to me on May 
6, 2025. On May 9, 2025, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 17, 2025. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified, presented witness testimony, and offered Applicant Exhibits 
 
 
                                         
 
   
    
     
   
 
 
     
      
     
  
 
   
       
    
 
 
    
    
      
 
       
     
    
  
 
  
  
   
    
     
     
          
   
   
   
  
   
 
(AE) A through B, which were admitted without objection. The documents submitted with 
her Answer will be referenced as AE C. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 1, 
2025. The record remained open until July 8, 2025, and Applicant timely submitted AE D 
through AE I. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s Answer she admitted she failed to timely file her Federal and state 
tax returns for the tax years 2021, 2022, and 2023 and that she has delinquent Federal 
taxes in the amount of $12,991 for those tax years . Her admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
Applicant is a 39-year-old executive assistant for a laboratory. She has worked for 
her sponsor since late 2023. She has never held a security clearance. She has taken 
some college courses but holds no degree. She married in 2022 and has no children. (GE 
1; Tr. 19-20.) 
Applicant admits she failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for 
tax years 20 21 through 2023, as required (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) . In her Answer , she 
emphasizes she disclosed this information to the DoD investigator who conducted her 
security clearance interview on March 11, 2024. She told the investigator that her 
accountant was located in another city, and she had not gotten around to going do wn 
there to meet with the accountant to do the 2021 and 2022 tax returns. She kept putting 
off the trip and she acknowledged to the investigator that her conduct was an issue. (GE 
4; AE A, AE C.) 
Applicant in her testimony and Answer cited that during the years 2021 and 2022 
she and her parents contracted COVID 19 and experienced long COVID symptoms. Her 
parents moved in with her from January 2022 until May 2022. She used the same tax 
preparer as her parents. Her parents and the tax preparer reside approximately four hours 
away. She stated, “because of the distance and because I just didn't get the time to get 
down there and to -- and to connect with him.” She had dealt with this preparer for years 
and he was her parents’ tax preparer. In her Answer for tax year 2023 she cited as 
reasons for her untimely filing that she had been in the process of looking for a new career 
and ultimately changing jobs. She offered as mitigation that she completed her filing on 
September 7, 2024, before the tax year 2023 extension period would have expired on 
October 15, 2024. She added she had never had a tax delinquency prior to 2021. 
(Answer; AE C; GE 1-4; Tr. 13-16, 20-27, 42-44, 50-55.) 
Applicant  admitted SOR ¶ 1.c. In her March 28, 2025 Answer to the Amended SOR  
she stated she would  set up a payment plan  to  “resolve/satisfy  this debt” for  delinquent  
Federal  taxes in the amount of $12,991.76 for tax years 2021,  2022, and 2023 .  At the 
hearing she submitted  her  Direct Debit  Payment Plan  with the IRS  from her  checking 
account, which showed a first payment date of June 28,  2025.  After the hearing she  
2 
 
 
                                         
 
 
    
    
   
      
  
 
 
        
 
    
 
    
    
   
  
    
     
     
    
  
 
  
 
    
   
submitted the May  9,  2025 correspondence with the IRS showing  that  she  had made 
arrangements to resolve tax years 2021,  2022, and 2023 with monthly installment  
payments.  The first payment  would apply  $228 to the balance and $22 for the setup fee.  
Her monthly payments  thereafter  would be $250, due  on the 28
th  of each month.  In post-
hearing submissions , she  provided the IRS letter confirming its  acceptance of  her  
payment plan (installment  agreement)  and she submitted her bank statement  that she 
has made the June 28, 2025 payment  as agreed, which was processed from her account  
on June 30,  2025.  (Tr.  42-45;  AE A,  AE C,  AE F,  AE I.)  
A
pplicant in previous tax years typically owed some amount for her Federal taxes. 
She estimated in tax years 2019 and 2020 she owed $1,500 to $2,000. She stated she 
was setting aside money for any taxes she would owe for the years in question. She did 
expect to owe taxes for tax year 2021. She acknowledged she was not expecting to owe 
$12,000. (Tr. 48-49, 55-56, 62.) 
After  Applicant  met with her  preparer,  it  took a month f or  the tax  returns  to filed. 
The process took two meetings costing her two days from work.  During the period in  
question,  while  Applicant’s  taxes remained  unfiled  because of  the distance to her  tax 
preparer,  she took multiple vacations abroad.  Applicant  took a vacation to  Spain  for 6-10  
days in September 2022 costing approximately $4,000. She took another vacation to 
Mexico  for approximately 5 days  in May 2023 costing $2,500 . In July 2023 she took  two 
more foreign vacations costing approximately  $2,500 and  $1,500  respectively. (Tr. 56-
59; GE 1.)  When asked why  she did not  use any  of  her  vacation time to go down and take  
care of  her  taxes  she responded, “that's a good question.  I do not know.”  (Tr. 59.)  
Applicant testified she has about $4,000 in savings, approximately $1,500 in her 
checking account, and around $10,000 in her 401(k). She has never had any financial 
counseling. (Tr. 35, 56-60; GE 1.) 
Although not alleged , Applicant has $2,541 in delinquent state taxes. She 
submitted her state payment agreement dated May 5, 2025, which I considered as 
mitigating whole- person evidence . She provided a letter from her state’s comptroller 
dated May 8, 2025, confirming the establishment of her payment plan, where the parties 
agreed to payments of $69.09 per month, for 36 months. She confirmed the first payment 
was due on June 15, 2025, and was processed by her bank on June 23, 2025. She also 
submitted her recent cash award from her sponsor for her excellent performance. (Tr. 59-
60; AE B, AE D, AE G, AE H, AE I.) 
Policies  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
3 
 
 
                                         
 
   
    
 
 
     
     
 
 
  
  
  
    
 
   
 
  
 
  
   
  
   
   
   
      
       
      
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
  
 
  
     
    
   
  
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance should not be construed to suggest that it 
is based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about the applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant ’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of

disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at  5 (App. Bd.  Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if  
they  must, on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).   
Analysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one ’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self -control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual ’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant ’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant ’s self -control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
AG ¶ 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and 
“(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or 
failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” The record 
establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(c), and 19(f). 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are as follows: 
5 
 
 
                                         
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
  
   
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
  
   
        
         
        
     
      
     
      
 
      
       
     
      
     
     
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  
 so infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;   
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  pr oblem were largely beyond  
the person's  control (e.g.,  loss of  employment, a business downturn,  
unexpected medical emergency,  a  death, divorce or separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or  identity theft), and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  and  
(g) the individual has  m ade arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  
arrangements.  
In IS
CR Case No. 10 -04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013) , the DOHA Appeal 
Board explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating 
conditions as follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
Applicant documented that she had filed her outstanding Federal and state income 
tax returns in September 2024, about two months before receiving the initial SOR and 
eight months after she disclosed on her SCA that she had not filed her tax returns. She 
told an investigator in March 2024 she had not filed her tax returns for tax years 2021 and 
2022 and acknowledged it was an issue. She then failed to timely file her 2023 tax return. 
Her behavior was not infrequent, and she filed her Federal and state income tax returns 
only after her security clearance application was in jeopardy, which casts doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. 
AG ¶ 20(g) is partially established. Applicant failed to timely file her Federal and 
state income tax returns for tax years 2021 through 2023. The first prong of AG ¶ 20(g) 
is met. She filed her tax returns and has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authorities to pay the amount owed. However , insufficient time has passed to establish 
that she is in compliance with the arrangements with the IRS. She has made one payment 
on the alleged Federal tax delinquency, and she offered as further mitigation that she was 
6 
 
 
                                         
 
       
  
  
       
       
   
   
    
    
 
  
    
  
    
  
    
   
     
  
     
   
      
   
  
   
 
     
        
 
  
 
  
   
   
   
 
   
  
 
  
   
  
   
     
in compliance with her recently established state arrangement . While her tax returns 
remained unfiled, and she accumulated a Federal tax debt of over $12,000, she had time 
to take multiple vacations prior to finally meeting with her tax preparer. Her vacations cost 
$10,000. Her f ailure to timely file Federal and state income tax returns , while taking 
numerous trips abroad, suggests she has a problem complying with well- established 
governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is 
essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01- 05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). The Appeal Board has noted that a clearance adjudication is not directed 
at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. 
Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. 
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate 
the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to 
classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); 
see Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. 
Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Her explanation blaming COVID might be mitigating 
until May 2022 but her inaction thereafter and her multiple vacations eviscerate any 
potential mitigation under either AG ¶¶ 20(b) or 20(g). Her claim of the di stance to her 
tax preparer preventing her filing is not supported by any legal authority. H er failure to 
ensure she was compliant with tax laws demonstrates poor judgment and lack of reliability 
required to be granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 17 -03049 
(App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016)); 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case 
No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01- 05340 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). 
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) , the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG ¶ 20(g) applied, and noted: 
The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in 
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who 
begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that 
his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self -discipline to 
follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat 
to his own interests. In this case, applicant’s filing of his Federal income tax 
returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background 
interview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action 
might otherwise merit. 
In this instance, Applicant filed h er overdue Federal and state income tax returns 
when she realized her security clearance application was in jeopardy. She entered into 
her payment plan with the IRS days before the hearing and her first payment was due 10 
days after the hearing. The Appeal Board has clarified that even in instances where an 
“[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] Federal [or state] tax problem, and the 
7 
 
 
                                         
 
   
  
 
   
   
 
  
   
 
     
      
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
      
     
   
  
  
   
 
     
         
     
      
    
    
      
       
   
fact that [a ]pplicant is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not 
preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] 
longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely pay 
Federal income taxes when due. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 
15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an applicant’s course of conduct 
and employing an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of 
access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of 
the SOR). 
Under all the circumstances, Applicant’s failures to timely file her Federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 20 21 through 2023 and pay her Federal taxes are not 
mitigated. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant ’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent,  and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the  
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  (4) the  
individual’s age and maturity at  the time of  the conduct; (5) the extent to  
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation  
and other permanent  behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the  
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   
Under AG ¶ 2(c), [t]he ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
I have considered Applicant’s state payment plan as whole person evidence. She 
admitted that she made errors; she relies on her past timely filings; and she promised not 
to repeat them as evidence of her rehabilitative potential. I also considered her recent 
award from her employer. The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed 
in the financial considerations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this 
time than the evidence of mitigation. Applicant’s failure to take timely, prudent, 
responsible, good-faith actions from 2022 to 2024 (when those tax returns were due) to 
timely file her tax returns raises unmitigated questions about her reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18.

It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant ’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against grant ing a security clearance. 
See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. “[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record 
discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.” ISCR Case No. 18 -02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case 
No.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With more effort towards establishment of a track record of timely filing her tax returns 
and further compliance with her payment agreement , she may well be able to 
demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST  APPLICANT   
Subparagraphs  1.a  - 1.c:  Against  Applicant  
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of 
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
