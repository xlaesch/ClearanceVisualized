Decision 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case  
On March 4, 2024, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) 
(SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On April 11, 2025, the Defense Counterintelligence 
and Security Agency (DCSA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as 
amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A, the 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 
2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA did not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
1 On September  17, 2 025,  Mr.  Hull  advised t hat Mr . A idan P . C onnor,  Esq., at   aconnor@berrylegal.com, 
would be representing Applicant  as of  September 17, 2025. (HE 4)  
 
 
 
   
   
      
     
     
 
 
 
      
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
      
    
     
    
 
   
      
   
 
  
        
  
    
      
     
     
SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE  2)  On  April 28,  2025, 
Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a hearing.  On  May 29,  2025, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed.  On June 2,  2025, the case was assigned to  
me. On  June 20, 2025, DOHA issued a notice setting the hearing for  July 18, 2025. (HE 
1) The hearing was held as scheduled, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference  
system. (HE 1)      
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered 
seven exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. 
(Tr. 35-39; GE 1-GE 6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE G) On July 28, 2025, DOHA received 
a copy of the transcript. Two exhibits were received and admitted into evidence without 
objection after the hearing. (AE H; AE I) The record closed on September 18, 2025. (Tr. 
76) 
Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. 
Findings of Fact  
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. 
(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact. 
Applicant is a 36- year-old program manager, and a government contractor has 
employed him since January 2024. (Tr. 40-41) He is engaged to be married. (Tr. 40) He 
does not have any children. (Tr. 40) He has an associate degree in education and an 
associate degree in applied sciences with an emphasis in accounting. (Tr. 40-41) 
Financial Considerations  
In his March 4, 2024 SCA, Applicant disclosed he had not timely filed his federal 
and state income tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. (GE 
1 at 28-29) His reason for not filing those tax returns was “anxiety” regarding the filing 
process. He said he “filed all unfiled tax returns in 2023.” (GE 1 at 28-29) 
In Applicant’s April 4, 2025, responses to DOHA interrogatories, he disclosed that 
he had not filed his TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal income tax returns, and he filed 
his state income tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2023 on April 2, 2025. (GE 2 at 5, 9) 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file as required his federal income tax 
returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. As of the date of this statement of reasons, these 
three tax returns remain unfiled. 
An undated Internal Revenue Service (IRS) document stated that Applicant either 
filed his tax returns late or may “be required to file a return based on reported income. ” 
(AE B) An IRS report indicated the returns were filed the following number of days late: 
TY 2020 (680 days); TY 2021 (347 days); TY 2022 (491 days); and TY 2023 (334 days).

(AE B) The IRS document did not address his TYs 2017 through 2019 federal income tax 
returns. 
Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts indicate no taxes are owed, and his federal income 
tax returns were filed or received by the IRS on the following dates: TY 2017 on July 28, 
2025; TY 2019 on May 1, 2025; TY 2020 on March 28, 2023; TY 2021 on March 28, 2023; 
TY 2022 on August 18, 2024; TY 2023 on March 15, 2025; and TY 2024 on April 15, 
2025. (AE C) He was unsure why he did not receive an IRS tax transcript for TY 2018 
from the IRS . (Tr. 53) He contacted the IRS the week before his hearing, and an IRS 
representative told him to fax his TY 2018 federal income tax return to the IRS. (Tr. 54) 
His August 5, 2025 IRS tax transcript for TY 2018 indicates no federal income tax return 
filed. (AE H) Applicant said he did not timely file his federal income tax returns because 
he believed it was unnecessary due to not having a tax liability. (Tr. 45) 
In 2023, Applicant realized he needed to file his federal income tax returns . He 
was aware that he could not receive a refund for tax returns filed more than three years 
after the due dates, and he decided not to file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 
through 2019 because he believed he would not owe any taxes. (Tr. 46) He suffers from 
anxiety related to filing tax documents, and he received mental -health counseling. (Tr. 
46-47) He sees a therapist every two weeks, and he receives medication to treat his 
anxiety. (Tr. 51) 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant failed to timely file, as required, state income tax 
returns for TYs 2017 through 2023. As of the date of the statement of reasons, he reported 
mailing the above returns to the state tax authority on April 2, 2025. 
Applicant admitted in his SOR response that he did not timely file his state income 
tax returns. (HE 3) He believed if he was not going to receive a refund, if the refund was 
below a certain level, or if he did not owe any taxes, then he did not need to file a state 
income tax return. (Tr. 46) On April 22, 2025, and August 27, 2025, the state tax authority 
certified that Applicant “has taken the necessary action to be in tax compliance with the 
Department as of the date of this letter.” (Tr. 55; AE D; AE I) 
In March of 2025, Applicant received a letter from the state tax authority indicating 
he owed about $1,500 to the state tax authority for 2022, and he decided to ensure his 
state tax records were correct. (Tr. 56-57, 69) He said after he filed his state income tax 
returns, the state revoked the letter he received in March of 2025. (Tr. 56-57) 
All of  Applicant’s required tax returns  are filed, and he does not owe any taxes.  (Tr.  
52-53) He received some counseling about filing tax returns from  his tax service. (Tr.  63-
64) He  understands now that  he is required to file his federal income tax returns when  
due regardless of whether taxes  are owed. (Tr. 48- 50)  He acknowledged that he was 
looking for reasons not to file his income tax returns, and he made a mistake when he  
failed to timely file his  tax returns. (Tr.  49, 72)  He said, “I was able to delude myself into  
thinking I  didn’t  really need to file the pa perwork, so  - - and I think that’s  really the core of  
what the issue was.” (Tr. 72)

Applicant promised to timely file his tax returns in the future. (Tr. 58) He is careful 
with his finances ; he does not have any delinquent debts; and he ensures that he has 
sufficient income to address his expenses. (Tr. 60; AE F) 
Character Evidence  
Applicant’s performance evaluations and character statements indicate he is an 
excellent employee. (Tr. 42; AE A) He received two spotlight awards at his current 
employment. (Tr. 43) He has no adverse employment actions. (Tr. 44) His facility security 
manager and a coworker and friend made statements on Applicant’s behalf. (Tr. 6-24) 
The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is diligent, trustworthy, reliable, 
and responsible. Their statements support his access to classified information. His 
supervisor at his current employment said: 
On many  occasions over the course of  [Applicant’s]  employment  [he has]  
demonstrated honesty and openness when many would not.  [Applicant]  
holds himself accountable and has shown [he takes]  his role very seriously.  
I believe [he]  genuinely understands and has fully taken responsibility for  
the situations brought to question regarding his clearance request.  
 
W
hile certainly not rising to the level of security classifications,  duri ng his  
time thus far, he has had access  to sensitive  business information including  
financials and i ndividual  salaries, and has   given me no pause about  his  
ability to maintain the confidentiality  of  the information and acknowledges  
the need to maintain proper control of information where needed.  (AE G)  
Policies  
The U.
S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority “to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy” to have access to such information. Id. at 527. Th e President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable, and unfavorable.

The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, this decision should not be construed to suggest that it is based on any express or 
implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an 
indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President, Secretary of 
Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established for issuing a clearance. 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan , 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95 -0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition  by substantial
evidence,  the burden  shifts to the applicant to rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or  mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶  E3.1.15. An applicant “has  the ultimate burden of  demonstrating that it  
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant  or continue his [or  her] security  
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 20700 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of  
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See  ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at  5 (App. Bd.  Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if  
they  must, on the side of denials.”  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;  see  AG  ¶ 2(b).  
 
A
nalysis  
Financial Considerations  
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts,  and meet financial
obligations may  indicate poor  self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise  
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to  
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial  distress can  also be  
caused or exacerbated by,  and thus can be a possible indicator of, other  
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,  mental  
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An

individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to
engage in illegal  or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The A
ppeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
This concern is broader than the possibility that  an applicant might  
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in  
satisfaction of  his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the  
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge  
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self -control,  
judgment,  and other qualities  essential to protecting the national secrets as  
well as  the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directi ve 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct  under any of the Guidelines  
and an applicant’s  security  eligibility.  
AG ¶ 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns . . . as required.” The record establishes the disqualifying condition in 
AG ¶ 19(f) , requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying condition is contained in the mitigation section, 
infra. 
The financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 which may be 
applicable in this case are as follows: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was  so infrequent, or occurred  
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does  not cast doubt  
on the individual’s current  reliability, trustworthiness,  or good judgment;  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial  problem were largely beyond  
the person’s control  (e.g., loss of employment, a business  downturn,  
unexpected medical  emergency, a death, divorce or  separation, clear  
victimization by  predatory lending practices, or identity theft),  and the  
individual  acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the individual  has received or is receiving financial counseling for the  
problem from  a legitimate and credible source, such as a non- profit credit  
counseling service,  and there are clear indications that the problem is being  
resolved or is under control;   
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good- faith effort to repay  
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
6 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
    
     
      
    
   
     
 
    
 
    
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
(g) the individual has  made 
 arrangements with the appropriate tax authority  
to file or  pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those
arrangements.  
 
The Appeal
 Board in ISCR Case No. 10- 04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as 
follows: 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or  maintenance of  
a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown,  913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th
Cir. 1990),  cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts  to the
applicant to rebut or  mitigate those concerns.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The  
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is  that  articulated in
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access  
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
Directive, Enclosure 2  ¶ 2(b).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Several circumstances beyond Applicant’s  control affected his  ability to timely  file  
his federal  and state income tax returns. He has anxiety  about  filing his tax returns, and  
he initially  believed he did not need to file his tax returns if he did  not  owe any taxes.  
However,  “[e]ven if [an applicant’s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part,  
due to circumstances  outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still  
consider whether [the  applicant]  has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing  
with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case  No. 05-11366 a t 4 n.9 ( App. Bd.  Jan. 12,  
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at  4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No.  99-
0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No.  99-0012  at  4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
Applicant  did not establish that he acted responsibly under  the circumstances.  He should  
have sought advice or  assistance from someone with more expertise in tax matters.  He 
could have reduced his  anxiety  by hiring someone to complete his tax returns.  He did not  
prove he was  unable to file his  tax returns sooner.  AG  ¶ 20(b)  is partially  established.   
A
pplicant failed to timely file as required his federal income tax returns for TY s 
2017, 2018, and 2019 and his state income tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2023. His 
federal and state income tax returns for those years were filed before his hearing in 2025. 
His anxiety and erroneous beliefs about filing not being required for tax returns if no taxes 
are owed warrant some delay in the filing of required tax returns; however, he did not 
provide sufficient justification for not filing his tax returns for such a long period of time. 
He acknowledged he was looking for an excuse not to file his required tax returns. 
In his March 4, 2024 SCA, Applicant disclosed he had not timely filed his TYs 2017, 
2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 federal and state income tax returns. His reason for not filing 
was “anxiety regarding filing process,” and he said he “filed all unfiled tax returns in 2023.”

(GE 1 at 28-29) He had not filed all unfiled tax returns in 2023. This issue was not alleged 
in the SOR. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board 
listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered 
stating: 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s 
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to 
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; 
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is 
applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under 
Directive Section 6.3. 
Id. (citing ISCR Case  No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-
0633 at 3 (App.  Bd. Oct. 24,  2003)).  See also  ISCR Case No.  12-09719 at 3 (App.  Bd.  
Apr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No.  14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR  
Case No. 03- 20327 at 4 (App.  Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Th is  non-SOR allegation ( false 
information o n his SCA)  will be considered in the credibility assessment  and  under the  
whole-person concept.  It will not be considered for disqualification purposes.  
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. § 7203, 
willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: 
Any person . . . required by this  title or by regulations  made under authority  
thereof to make a return, keep any records,  or supply  any information, who 
willfully fails to . . .   make such return, keep such records, or supply such  
information, at the time or  times required by law or regulations,  shall, in  
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor. . .  .  
A willful failure to make return, keep records,  or supply information when required,  
is a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of  any tax liability.  Spies v. United  
States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943);  United States v.  Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9
th  Cir. 1973);  United  
States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969);  O’Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  
Cir. 1931).  For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely  
file his federal income  tax returns against him as a crime  or as  disqualifying information. 
Regarding  the failure to timely file his federal income tax returns, the Appeal Board has  
commented:  
F
ailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has  a problem with
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary  
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.  ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at  3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not  directed at collecting  
debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at  5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By  
the same token,  neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax  
returns. Rather, it is  a proceeding aimed  at  evaluating an applicant’s
judgment and reliability.  Id.  A person who fails repeatedly  to fulfill his  or her

legal obligations does  not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment  
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information.

Case No. 15-01031 at  4 (App. Bd. June 15,  2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-

20,  2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App.  Bd. Aug. 18,  2015).   
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longst anding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well that 
ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information 
with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). 
The facts and disposition of ISCR Case No. 15 -01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
clarify that even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, grant of access 
to classified information may be inappropriate. In that case, the applicant filed his 2011 
federal income tax return in December 2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 
2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in October 2015. He received federal tax refunds of 
at least $1,000 for each year. The Appeal Board noted: 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated, “my decision to delay filing  
was completely  unrelated to any financial  over-extension or  unpaid debt
circumstances encountered on m y  behalf.  I  delayed filing a tax return
specifically due to the fact that, in each case,  I pre-determined that I  would 
receive a tax refund.  The pre- determined calculation was based on my
known tax deductions  for each year.” He also stated he regretted failing to 
file his tax returns in a timely manner,  understood that filing late because he  
expected a refund was  an unacceptable practice, and pledged  to file his tax  
return before the April  15 deadline.  
 
 
 
 
N
evertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge’s decision to grant 
access to classified information in ISCR Case No. 15- 01031 at 4-5 (App. Bd. June 15, 
2016) to the Applicant who did not owe any taxes; only three tax returns were late; and 
no tax returns were filed more than 20 months late. 
In ISCR Case No. 15 -06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG ¶ 20(g) applied, and noted:

The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important  factor in  
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who  
begins to resolve financial problems  only after being placed on notice that  
his clearance was in jeopardy  may lack the judgment  and self-discipline to  
follow rules  and regulations over time or when there is  no immediate threat  
to his own interests. In this case,  applicant’s filing of  his Federal income tax  
returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background  
interview,  or receiving the SOR  undercuts the weight such remedial action  
might  otherwise merit.  
In this instance, Applicant failed to timely file multiple federal and state income tax 
returns, and some were filed after he completed his SCA. The information in his SCA 
about unfiled tax returns was not accurate. Applying the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence, 
he did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress sooner in the filing of his 
tax returns. Under all the circumstances, Applicant’s failures to timely file his federal and 
state income tax returns are not mitigated at this time. 
Whole-Person Concept  
Under the whole- person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole- person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole- person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant is a 36- year-old program manager, and a government contractor has 
employed him since January 2024. He has an associate degree in education and an 
associate degree in applied sciences with an emphasis in accounting. Applicant’s 
performance evaluations and character statements indicate he is an excellent employee. 
He received two spotlight awards at his current employment. He has no adverse 
employment actions. The general sense of his character statements is that Applicant is 
diligent, trustworthy, reliable, and responsible. The character evidence supports his 
access to classified information.

The evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial 
considerations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial than the evidence of 
mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to file his overdue federal and 
state income tax returns sooner. His failure to take timely, prudent, responsible, good-
faith actions from April 2018 (when his TY 2017 tax returns were due) to 2025 (when his 
TY 2017 tax returns were filed) , raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. 
See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. “[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record 
discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.” ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case 
No.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. 
With establishment of a track record of timely resolution of his tax issues, he may well be 
able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
the AGs, and the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the 
context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate Guideline F security concerns. 
Formal Findings  
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs  1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Conclusion  
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of 
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
